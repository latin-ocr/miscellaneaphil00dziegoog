INTRODUCTION. LXXIII

is all the more astonisbing when we think ol the amount ol mental work
requisite sor writing upon such abstruse subjects.

(3). contenta of the Work.

Before giving a detailcd analysis ol Wyclil's doctrine, it is well to
point out what Scholastics meant by maner aud by form, so as to see
how much os novelty there was in his views

ln general, and in the widest sense ol all, sorrn was that which rnade
dillerence¹ between a thing existing in one way and existing in another3
whilst matter was that which made it identical with itsell, though modified.
Thus, a piece ol wax is now spherical, now cylindrieal: sphericity or
cylindricity would be the form: the underlying wax, identical notwithstanding
the change, would be the matter. So lar as the changes which we observe
only bear upon shape‚ colour, and the other qualities perceived by sense,
the doctrine seems a mere statement ol facts. But it was affirmed that
changes are going sorward in nature which imply the production ol a
totally new being, and the destruction ol the former one, so that we can
no longer properly say, ‘This is the same substance’, as wc can in the
case ol wax. For when, for instance, wax is subjected to destructive

distillation, aud can no longer revert to its former appearance, the change
is decper and more substantial. T hat - whatever it may be -- which

unrlerlies the present vapour, is not now capable of being a solt yellow
mass. And yet, since wax changes into this vapour, there is something
which all the time is the subject both os the wax and the vapour. 'l'hese
are two specifically different substanceS‚ with the same identical substratum,
aud as wax as asphere or a cylindcr is indifferent to either of these
shapes, so the mysterious substratum is indifferent to being visible or
invisible, a combustible solid or a highly inllammable gas. But the wax
comes lrotn thc pollen ol a plant, which in its turn has taken all that it
is Irom the surrounding elements3 and here again wc have a further
substantial change: lrorn the inorganic elements to the living plant, lrorn
the living plant to a product which is organic but not organized; from

¹ Not the dissercuce ilsels. Wyclif, as wc shall sec, takes ‘form' to mean this
differem, whether substantia} or accidental, and this ol course, as a relation butu-cen
two or more objects related, was necessarily a llnivcrsal.
