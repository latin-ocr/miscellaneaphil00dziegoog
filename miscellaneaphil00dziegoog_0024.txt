AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF’S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM. XVII

all its points taken away from a line, can 1 maintain that the line is
entire? for it is nothing more than all its pointS‚ just as the whole is all
its parts. They are thus parts of the line, each touching every other,
yet no two in the same place. This is not only not absurd, but necessary3
each point stands for a certain sured position in space: mutual contact
cannot destroy their one essential property. By a like reasoning we prove
that a surfacc consists of lines, and that a volume is made up of suffoces,
A line, a sorsaco, or a volume that is by hut one point less than another,
is smaller than that other.

Again, suppose that two bodies touch: where they touch, do their
points colncide? lf they did, they could not belong to different bodies,
Two points never can become one, however near: at the limit‚ therefore,
they are also distinct. The surfaces of air and water touch. A stone
falls into the water. Will it not frrst reach the bottommost surface of
the air, and the topmost surface of the water afterwards? Each surface,
being respectively of air and of water, cannot be the same, unless
air be water.

These proofs do not satisfy Wyclifs antagonists. ln their opinion,
a point, a line, or a surface, is butan abstraction (if it be even that);
space itself is only arbetion, if taken apart from singulars occupying
space. And at any rate a point is not a part of it3 according to Geometry,
both points, lines and surfaces may and do coincide. But how can they
have the face to invoke the authority of Geometry, when their whole
system means the utter destruction of that science? Since a line is an
abstraction, how can one be twice as great as another? You can bisect
aliue3 can you cut an abstraction in two? According to us, one line
is twice as long as another when the multitude of its points is twice as
great. That number, though no man - possibly no creature- is able
to count it, exists, and is known to God. Such is our idea, clear and
intelligible; but what of theirs? If there beno such thing as a line, how
can there be, between two lines, either equality or inequality? You
cannot compare two nothingnesses together. If we seem to contradict
Geometry, we only seem to do so; whereas your contradiction is open

and flagrant.
The composition of time, which we say consisto of succesive in-

divisible instants, is yet more evidently demonstrable, if socha thing
cau be. Wyclifs opponents say that the end of one state and the
