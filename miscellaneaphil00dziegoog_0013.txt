So great a sall from such a heightdoes not in the least imply
that Wyclii, whether in the past or now, has met with more or with
less attention than he deserved. He was a man ol his time, great in his
generation: but changing times have not only taken away all savour ol
actuality srom the work he did and the problema which he tried to solve3
they have rendered him unintelligible both to the general public and to
those who are not ignorant ol philosophy. Out ol a thousand men trained
in modern Metaphysical lore, scarcely one would be able to read and
understand the five volumes ol Wyclil's philosophical works that have
lately seen the light3 and not many would care to peruse the Introductions
aud side-notes in which the editors have striven to set sorth Wyclis s
meaning. Not only the problcms which interested his contemporaries are
dead, but the methods and the very terminology by which he attempted
their solution are dead likewrse. and to all such as are not philosophers,
these volumes are no better than waste paper. On looking through
them - if respect lor the name of the great lorgotten one kept back
some very natural expression of contempt- they surely would experience

something os what the Arab may leel, when he pitches his goat—skin

tent on the ruins ol some vast city: “l wonder how anyone could under·
take such gigantic and such useless work !”

Assuming that the reader who opens this volume is likely to ex·
perience some such feeling, and yet is willing to be interested in Wyclil' s
philosophy, is possible, my task is a very simple, though, it must be con·
sessed, a very arduous one. Ι intend to state, as plainly as 1 can, and
putting aside all technicalities that are not indispensable, the main features
of Wyclilfs system, as I have understood it, lshall strive to take his
own point of view3 and thoughl need hardly say that it is not mine,
will do my utmost to place it in the best and most convincing light, so
that the reader may at least vaguely understand how it was that he
possessed such inlluencc over his contemporaries3 and also how his '
mind, working from point to point, from first principles to ultimate in·
serences, brought him finally into conllict — unwilling conssict, as I
believe- with more than one dogma os the Church. Here, and with
the purpose stated, I hold a briei for Wyclif.

What was that Nominalism in which our philosopher (as he tells
us himself) was bred, from which he broke away early iu his career,
and which he afterward [ought with such energy during the whole ol
