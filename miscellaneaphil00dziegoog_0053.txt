’ and since it has pleased God to create a world of substances‚ a world
of accidents would be less perfect. Our author's answer to these argu-
ments is strikingly moderate. 'lhey have, he says, but little power to
persuade3 the opinion is only based upon saith, and the hypothesis that
God might supply the place of a substance: his own theory, he thinks,
is more reasonable. He points out various flaws in the explanationS‚ and
the great confusion that would arise if they were admitted: we should
grope in the dark, unable to distinguish between substance and acci·
dent. Any entity that acts just like a substance, must really be one, for
we have no means of knowing that it is not. And then, God's action
would tend — infallibly tend — towards making us affirm that which is
false. The answer about a world of accidents is, he says with a touch
of malice, though it is mildlyexpressed, ‘quedam theologizacio'. And be
ends with the remarking that the last answer ‘seems to him unsatisfactory’
(pp. 121-127).

It is, as Isaid, impossible to decide whether this treatise was
written before or just after Wyclif became Mastcr of Ballio] Hall3 but
for those who know his usually vigourous style both of argument and
of expression, the former alternative may seem not improbable.

When Ι was in London, between 1889 and 1890, editing various
works of Wyclif, Dr. Furnivall sent me a copy of this Replicati0‚ with a
somewhat lengthy Introduction in English, and a title-page stating that
the work was edited by Ἀ. Herman Lundstrom, T heol. Kand. Pastor
of Helga T refaldighet Church‚ Upsala‚ Sweden3’ but without either the
variantes of the Prague University MS. Ill. G. 10, or any marginal notes,
and the Introduction was chiefly a description of the famous Stockholm
Ms, written ‘per manus Mag. Joh. Hus'. lt became my duty to complete
this work for publication by the Wyclif Society; hut when I examined
it, I soon came to such very startling conclusions that Ι tried to com-

1That is, the Stockholm MS. As 111. G. 10 of Prague University is one of
the sources for the text of De Materia el Forma, its description eomes in the
introduction to that work,
