LXVIII INTRODUCTlON.

really include its singular, as it must by its universal nature. The underlying
question is whether, if you allow that the Universal has a separate
existence ol its own, independent ol any one of its singulare, you are able
to count the Universal and its singular separately as two, Not only you
are able, but you must; but is 80, you have tivo singulars, one ol which
is not the other. And this must, in the system ol Real Universals‚ be
denied: the Universal and its singular are one. How then can one include
the other? This is a palpable hir, and Wyclil does not aflect to make
light of it. He admits that the argument is well put and seemingly conclusive,
but ‘provisionally' (quo ad presens) denies the conclusion. And further,
on p. 144, we see him in the meshes of a similar difficulty, first admitting
the conclusion that ‘the existence os one thing may be that ol another),
and then adding — as an alter-thought, his opponent maliciously remarks
—- a distinction against which there is a strong and apparently unans-
werable argument. Ol course this is the crux ol the matter. Give the
Universal Humanhy, Animation - what you will - only ideal existence,
and the difficulty disappears The problem is how to think them as real
things, other thau their singulam, yet identical with them; and il other,
then singulars or units which can be counted; and yet universal. However
great Wyclil's philosophical acumen may have been, it is no wonder if
he tloundered about a little just in this place. We may leave him so:
this review ol the two most interesting parts in the debate will, I think,
suffice in lieu ol the detailed contents ol so short a treatise.

Os this work there are no fewer than seven manuscripts extant.
Shirley gives six ol thern in his catalogue3 the seventh is the Stockholm
MS, written by Huss in all probability, and lor that reason taken as text.
Of the others, 1 omitted collating Prag. Univ. 8. G. 23 and 5. H. ro,
because, having looked over them, I thought their variants of little
importance to the text, and in most cases concurring with those already
noted, except where they gave blunders ol their own. I need not say that
this step was only taken with the full concurrence of Dr Furnivall.
Lundstrdm's Introduction gives a very complete description of the Stock-
