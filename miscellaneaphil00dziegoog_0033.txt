destroyed) that at the bottom ol all our enquiries into first principles
we find sels-contradiction on every side, and that accordingly, though
we cannot really tell what Time and Space are, we should confine our
investigations to what is in Time and Space: — this well-known, this
world-renowned theory, is based on an implicit denial that things are as
we know them. All knowledge dissolves into sels-contradiction3 things
alone do not contradict themselves.

ls there then no answer to the question, save plain· Yes or No?
no middle way between the absolute affirmative ol the one class, and
the uncompromising negative ol the other? There is; but in that very
answer we see the reason why it falls to satissy.

Do things exist as they are known to us? AS is a very short
word, but it has two meanings nevertheless. ·Let us look closer. Are
things seen in a looking-glass as they are in reality? Yes and no. There
is a certain resemblance, more or less perfect, il that be meant3 but
the difference is always that between the image and the original. ln like
manner, - so lar as any comparison can be drawn, - the human intellect
is the mirror ol Nature. Our thoughts are indeed in a way the images
ol things3 but we can no more conclude that things have the same
nature as our thoughts than we can infer that a nosegay out ola
looking·glass is ol quicksilver amalgam, because its image within the
looking-glass is not a thing distinct lrorn the silvering. Thus, things do
really exist as they are known to us: that is, they giving rise to our
thoughts and ideas, we have the right to reason from the latter to the
former. There must be some resemblance, however vague, between
representation and that which is represented. Il it were totally unlike in
representation, it would not be represented at all. - But, il AS is made
to mean a complete identity ol nature between what we know and our
knowledge, then it may be boldly denied that things are as we know
thern. What we know ol a grain ol sand is not identical with what it
is in itsell3 sor what we know os it extends only to a lew points ol
view, and there will ever remain infinite possibilities ol more knowledge.
All the sophisms in the world will never overthrow this simple yet clear
distinction.

Now it is precisely because this answer‚ given by many great
philosophers, is so very cautious and moderate, that we leel disappointed.
Itis the old tale of Scylla and Charybdis over again, the breakers that
