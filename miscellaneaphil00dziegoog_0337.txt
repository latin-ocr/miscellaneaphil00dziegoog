Marrer, Aristotle's definitior 01, 185 and

note,· primal matter is successively
fire, earth, 010, 216, 2173 this is
proved by scripture, 217-2zo; to the
obiection that theri no substance would
ever begin or cease to be, the answer
is that all things were created together
in their essences, 221, 222, but not
the compounds themselves, 222, 223;
for the union 01 matter with form has
its beginning intime, 223; that which
began with tIme may be called cor-
ruptible or notas we please, in diffe-
rent senses, which is a good way to
answer sophists, 223, 224; this doc·
trine being in agreement with Scrip-
ture, Aristotle is wrong where he con-
tradicts it, 2245 Scriptural expressions
are literally true in Wyclifs doctrine,
225: and it would by no means con-
fuse the persons 01 the Trinity, ia,-
that primal matter is never formless
does not prove that it has no entity
oi its own, 2263 we can only say 11
has no form by itself‚ aad therefore
its nature is 1011111000, though it re-
quires a form to exist, 227.¹ Obiection
that every creature exists eternally in
God, and yet the non-existence oi the
world· is eternally known to be true,
228; to which we may either reply
that ‘non-existence' does not contradict
the idea of possible entity, but actual
existence only, 228, 229 ; or that there
never was or will be any such thing
as absolute non-existence, 230—232;
God's knowledge 01 the world as
non-existing is not absolute, since
the world 10 now, and from all
eternity was about io be; 232, 233;
God does not see the being of that
which is not, but sees 11 10 b'e pos·

Mertai acts are universally admitted to

exist, 15 three theories concerning them,
