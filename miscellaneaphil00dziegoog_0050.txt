INTRODUCTION. XLIII

see, but even if enred, his ‘having been blind’ would still be true as a
contingent fact. To this Wyclif demurs, and will not admit any possi-
bility from which the time-element is eliminated. To say that I may not have
existed is to say that my non-existence is thinkable3 but to me it is not,
and the contrary proposition is an absolutely necessary truthfpp.65—7 l.
The arguments on the opposite side are now refuted, after several
distinctions asto complete and incomplete necessity, the former either
absolute (created or uncreated) or'relative3 and these distinctions show
thatin the whole question there is a' great confusion of terms. The
author understands by necessity something which is not in all cases op· Ι
posed to contingency. Yet he affirms that truths in the past are of such
nature that their contradictories are inconceivable (pp. 71—74). The
Necessary cannot become contingent, but the Contingent becomes ne-
cessary by the fact that it has taken place: Noiv it cannot not have
been. Whatever distance there may be between contingency and necessity,
time and the concourse of God's action in the world can get over it.
And each contingent truth has in it, as an essential factor, the possi-

bility of becomiug necessary. 1Ιῑ does not follow, because God is free to

give this necessity, that He is free to take it away3 and this is proved
by many instances. That we can admit that a thing has not happened
which has happened in reality proves only that we may be wrong, or
that we wish to see the result of making such an admission; and notas
all that it may possibly be either true or not true. Any truth that exists
is eternal; it is neither annihilable, nor capable of being created aneu.
We say that a man who does not yet exist is able to spend money
lin the futore), but that a dead man cannot possibly spend money (in
the past). Why? Because can indicates a potentiality which in the first
case exIsts, but in the second exists no longer. As to God’s power, we
cannot make it extend, though infinite, to the realization of absurdities3
what is not ‹to-able cannot hedone, even by Him. This does not re-
duce His power3 for we do not deny that lle can do whatever by any
possibility can be done. The knowledge of the past enables uS, not to
change that past, but to change the future by means of the present.
Can 1 not have done better than I did at such and such a time? No, I
‹zannot now; but I could then. The Past is unchangeable. Our con·
trition is not properly for the Past, nor does it change the past: it
is for the present state produced in us by past acts, it changes that. and
