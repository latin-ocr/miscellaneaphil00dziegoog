LX INTRODUCTION.

as well as subsequently, we find Huss also occupied in resistance to
the attacks to which Wyclil's Realism was exposed from the prevaiing
School of Nominalism. One of his contemporaries and declared opponents,
Stephen von Dolein, also states in his “Epistola ad Hussitas’, that at first
among the teachers at Prague Huss was almost the only one who received
Wyclif's writings with joy, read them and handed them over to others
for study and their future guidance, though there are also some persons
who entered their gentle protest against him, persons who now (Dolein
wrote in 1417) rest in the Lord and others who are yet alive” (Luserth
p. 96). And lastly, when we add to this the fact that the treatises‚ as Ι
have shown, were undoubtedly written by the hand of Huss we must
allow it to be highly probable that they actually formed his first public
lectures.

Since then noue of Wyclif’s philosophical writings have been printed
and published hitherto; and since, furthermore‚ it is probable that these
treatises are Huss’ earliest lectores, the contents of the Stockholm MS.
must be of no little interest both as a contribution to our knowledge of
Huss and in connexion with the question of the general tendency of Wyclifs

philosophy, about which extremely little is known.¹ And besideS, these

writings of 500 years ago help to throw some light on the general sub·
ject of scientifrc University life at that date.

Dr. Dudik t00‚ thirly years ag0‚ expressed a wish in this direction3
though hitherto no one has devoted himself to the task. I may perhaps
quote the Bohemian scholar's own words: “Und somit bleibt kein anderer
Wunsch‚ als dass diese Schriften in ihrem lnhalte gehdrig gewfirdigt
werden mdchten. Fur Wyclif so gut wie fur dessen Schfiler, Huss, haben
sie immer einen Werth und als Autograph sind sie eine kostbare Reliquie,
wie fiir Bdhmen, so fiir die ganze gelehrte Welt.‘’

Lastly, it may be asked how it is that no Swedish scholar has taken
in hand and endeavoured to interpret this precious manuscript, which
has now for so long, — in fact nearly 250 years, - been in the
possession of Sweden, after having passed the first 250 years of its
existence in the keeping of Bohemia. The reason of this no doubt is partly

¹ Nor will it bc disputed that these treatises of Wyclifs which contem, so
to say, the propaedeutics of his theology, deserve to be publihed from this point
of view also (vide Lechler a. a. l, p. ²4 et passim).
