the woman cat, the Felis domesticus and the nine-tailed whip. Buta
consistent Nominalist would be forced to say that we docket these with
names lor the convenience ol classification‚ and that equivocal terms arc
just as general as terms which are univocal since the word alone is in
both cases common to all the singulars! Now this distinction is the
basis of all reasoning3 all men agree that no inserence with equivocal
terms has the least value. ‘Why is the Stock Exchange like the sky?
Because there are bears in both’, may be meant lor a joke, never lor
au argument. Nominalists of course shilt their ground at once, and say
that they intend to exclude fictitious resemblances3 those alone which are
natural can be admitted. Then what are and where are these resemblances?
Not in the mind alone3 therefore either in the things themselves, or
between them. And as they are forced to admit that the word means
these resemblanceS, they are no longer pure Nominalists; lor the
likeness between Smith and Browu is the same as that between Brown
and Smith.

This brings us to Conceptualism, which is the same error in a
less virulent but more insidious [orm. “Something in my idea os one
man’', the Conceptualist would say, “is indeed identical with something
in my idea of another3 and therefore hunzanity is something more than
aword3 it is a thought. But there is nothing in the man Smith, nothing
in the man Brown, which is really and truly identical in both. When we
speak us their common humanity, we are speaking of an abstraction
that cannot exist otherwise than mentally, not ol the actual essence ol
the men themselves'’ ln this doctrine, of course, a queen in a card-
pack, un a chess board‚ in a hee-hive, or issuing a proclamation, is a
word standing lor four distinct ideas3 and there is no doubt that Con-
ceptualism gets over the lormer difficulty.

But there are plenty ol otherS, which neither Conceptualists nor
Nominalists can avoid. A chemist has three glass jars ol hydrogen; that
is, he applies one and the same idea, “hydrogen’‘, to the contents ol
each jar. And his reason for doing so, the Conceptualist readily admitS,
is the likeness which he perceives between them. But where is that
likeness? In his mind only? It must be so, according to the system3 sor
it the likeness exists in the specimens os hydrogen - in jars No 1,
No 2 and No3 —- it is identical with itsell everywhere, it is a universal
likeness really existing in the things: which would contradict the Con-
