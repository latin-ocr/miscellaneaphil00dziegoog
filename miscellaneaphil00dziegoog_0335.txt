‘ln what manner does this thing existi’
ite they add an entity, but onlya
modal one, to their subject, 165‚166;
God is called by augustine, the Su-
preme Mode, but not in this sense,
‘mode' here meaning goodness and
order, 166; the sense of ‘mode' as an
accident means one of the nine cate·
gories exclusive of substance, 1673 the
disputes as to the entity conferred by
amode is one ol mere words, 168;
entity, when predicated of accident and
of substance, has two like but not
identical meanings, ih,- some say that
an accident is nothing, and that all
beings are substances, some that God
alone is a substance and all other
beings are accidents; both views are
exaggerated, but the latter is nearest
the nuth, 167, 168; substantial form
is that by which any substance is that
substance, 1763 two kinds, one requi·
ring no subject to sustain their entity,
as angels, 177, who ere not made up
of matter and lorm,178; the other, of
forms upheld by a body, 179, are merely
the whole essence, taken abstractly,
ib; it is foolish to think of matter and
form as two separate but combined
partS, ol which the substance con-
sists‚ 179, 180; or that the latter is
capable of increase and diminution, lor
that would then be accidental, not sub-
stamini, which is added or taken away
from the form, 1803 but we may un-
derstand substantial form in a wider
sense, as that which is always found
with the substance, 182. Obiection
that this view destroys specific diffe-
rences, by positing that the same one
essence may become anything in the
world, 182, 1833 answered by the fact
that essence bears no reference to
genera or species; one thing cannot be
another at the same time, 183-185;

the Trinity, Christ's duel nature, and

ol a form is not movement (or change),
193 ; every form is, in a sense, acci-
dental to matter, ib ,· but when its sub-
ject is absolutely potential, it gives it
actual substantiality, 194; the recepti-
vity of matter, utterly passive, cannot
be called a form or a determination,
194, 195. Obiections: that in this view
matter and form are identical, or the
expositorial syllogism is worthless, 196;
that the examples given explain the
unknown by the unknown, 197, and
that, if matter end form be not
identical, they are two different beings
occupying the same space, ib.,· ans-
wered by the statement that these are
not identical, though they go to form
one and the same essence, 198; matter
is the essence qud receptiva ol form,
form is the essence qud generable in
matter, 2003 the simple essence,
receiving form, becomes composite,
201, 2023 these distinctions given, no
expositorial syllogism concludes any-
thing against Wyclil. 2033 he does not
prove the unknown by the unknown,
but points out that any attack upon
his doctrine menaces Christianity, 204,
205; the difference between matter and
lorm is merely logical, 205, 206.

Fece-will was always at least nomi-
nally admitted by Wyclil, 111111.
