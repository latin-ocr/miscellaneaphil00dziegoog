LII INTRODUCTlON.

(uel scripturaml¹ praevalidam declino ab opinione priori non obstante lama
vel assercione virorum quos sequerer, considerans quod ex infirmitate
nature longe plus habeo ignorancie quam certitudinis - quod si ex
ignorancia vel quacunque alia causa (Hus: vel lapsu lingue) in isto
deiecero ...revoco et retracto submittens me humiliter.

ln Huss' treatise “De irinitaie'’ we smd the same thought expressed
in almost the same words

According to Dudik, this manuscript shows an excessive number oi
abbreviations, is somewhat indistinctly and hastily written, and is conse-
quently especially difficult to decipher3 and the experience Ι have gained
srom the study ol its numerous obscurities leads me fully to endorse
Dudik’s opinion.

Ι will now record some observations on the subject ol the writing
itseli, as it appears in the different treatises

In the first there are 37 or 38 lines to the page. The last page
has however only six lines, and os these two are in red: “Explicit tractatus

etc. The initial letters oi the chapters are red3 as are also several marginal

notes referring to the contents. Commas, stops and dividing marks occur
in the text, but the words are nevertheless occasionally run together.

There are besides numerous corrections and emendations in saint
writing. These alterations seem as a rule to have been made by a
contemporary, but strange, hand, a iew passages only showing signs of
correction by a somewhat later writer. Lastly Ι may mention that here
and there spaces are leit ior omitted words.

In the second treatise also corrections and omissions are to be
iound e. g. leaves 31 and 40. — On leai 54 appears a phrase added
by a later hand to fill up an original omission: — “a condendis nouis
generibus creature’'.

The state os the third treatise is very much the same. For omis-
sions I may referto leaves 60, 71, 75, 76, (the same pages are mentioned
by Dudik).

In the fourth occur only two corrections and no omissions. In this
treatise‚ the only one in which are no Bohemian words, there is also
nothing in red ink, except the numbers of the pages and the first initial letter.
