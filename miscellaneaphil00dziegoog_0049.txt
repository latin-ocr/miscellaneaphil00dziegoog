XLII INTRODUCTlON.

in the past, it becomes somewhat less easy to admit that if Ι say: “Had
Ι not given my last penny to a beggar just now, Ι should be able to
ride home on this tramcar,'' Ι am pointing out the consequences 0f an
absurd supposition. There is therefore, it seemS, plenty o'f room for de-
bate3 and here Wyclif is content to give his opponents the first inuings

“What is contingent at any time cannot become necessary. It is
not necessary that Ι exist now3 Ι can conceive my not existing; there·
fore I can conceive my ‘not having existed yesterday'. What could
make this necessary? what could change the nature of a contingent truth,
and pass over the infinite distance which separates Contingency from

necessityiss' The denial of such a truth in the past] is false indeed, but

not unthinkable, as it should be in Wyclif's theory. We ¹can argue con-
sistently from such a denial asa premise: it cannot therefore be absurd‚
for the Absurd is defined as that from which anything, true or false,
may follow, if it be posited. As we say of things present that they are,
so we say of things past that they are possible3 and if what is may be
otherwise so what has been may possibly have been otherwise. lf God has
infmite power over the present, he has no less over the past3 if He cau
prevent things happening now, He can also make them not to have
taken place. Even man can do that. lf we say that roe might tave done
otherwise llran roe have dorae, the word might signiftes that our having
done otherwise is actually (not was) a possibility. Besides, as a fact,
our capacity for amendment and repentance exists3 but we cannot do
better than what we have done, nor can we sorrow for it, if it be ab·
solutely necessary'’ (pp. 59—65).

Wyclif (proceeding here according to the plan of St. Thomas in
his Str-mma lerologica) next gives his own arguments on the contrary
side, and winds up by refuting those of the adversary. Whatever is so
true that it cannot cease to be true, is necessary; and this is the case
withvthings that have happened in the Past. God Himself cannot restore
lost virginity. The Past is immutably what it is3 and therefore its truth
is necessary. If the same thing could happen again, the return of adead
man to life would be no miracle. Any singular proposition referring to
a fact may be known as eternally ,and therefore necessarily true. Why
should we take thought for the future, if we can make the past not to
have been? Here the adversaries say that, speaking of possibility, they
abstract from time, a man who is blind might be not blind, and may
