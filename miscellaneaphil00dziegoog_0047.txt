XL INTRODUCTION.

Rellection is impossible, sor we cannot conceive the act knowing itsell3
and il we know a sels-existent act, distinct from ourselves‚ it is only by
means ol a third act, which itsell would have to be known by a fourth,
and so on lor ever. - Let me note by the way that those who have
denied the existence ol a Subject in modern times have been also
driven to deny that we rellect upon ourselves3 we only, in their theory,
seem to do s0. — Do these acts depend upon us, ordo they not? Il
our awareness of them has nothing to do with their existence, what sort
ol beings are they? (pp. 27-33). - Wyclil winds up with some dilli-
culties about pain, considered as a mental act or feeling, and bearing
on the punishments ol Hell and Purgatory, which he contends would in
this theory become equal.

Ch. 2 need not be noticed, as it is but a short summary ot the
objections which he solves in the next chapter.

Ch. 3. Wyclis, in his answers, begins by assuming several different
senses in which the word action is used, and several different species
ol action. ln the widest or transcendental sense it may mean the very
essence ol a being, when the latter (God) has no accidents: but in all
other senses it is something accidental to the being which acts
(pp. 38-42). The opponents say: Actions make men good or bad; and
what makes men good or bad must be a quality. The answer is that,
not the actions themselves but their goodness or wickedness, produce
this result. The adversaries point out that whatever changes the state ol the
soul must be a quality, making it qualis· and mental acts belong to this
category. But it is replied that this is true, il by quality we understand
tlte sotrl as llius or llius changed· salse, if we would make of it a subtle
entity that can exist independently ol the soul (pp. 42—45). Here Wyclil
indulges in a short digression concerning grace, where Ι would note,
in connection with the date of the work, a striking combination ol
prudence and boldness; prudence, in his confirming himself to deny the
sels-existence of grace3 boldness in censuring only in the mildest terms
those who in the sace of the whole 'l‘homist School, assert that grace
is notua real entity. lbelieve this is now an open question among
Scholastic theologians3 but had Wyclil gone farther than he did, he
would have set many an Oxford divine most bitterly against him
(pp. 45247). — “ll'’, say the adversarieS, “a mental actis not move-
ment, it must be a quality3 and it cannot possibly be a movement'’.
