the wax to the vapour. And throughout all these changes ol external
qualitics, something remains unchanged; and that something must therefore
be itsell absolutely indeterminate, but capable ol receiving any determination.
This was Primal Matter; and its determinatione — such at least as made
it pass lrom one class ol substance to another — were called Substantial
Forms. Every stone, every plant, every animal, every man, was merely
primal matter plns a substantial form of its own. ‘l'hese were not merely
two names for the same thing, or the same thing from two points of
view. To be determinat and lo determine, lo receive and lo give, are not
only different, but incompatible attributes. What gives “waxness”, though
not really distinct srom wax, must be distinct lrom that which, from not
wax, becomes wax, or in other words receives “waxness”.

Thus primal matter and substantial [orm are the two really different

elements into which we must resolve everything that is subject to sul-

stantial change. Matter can in no case subsist without form, since it has
no quality but receptibility ol form, and even that is a purely passive
quality. All the lower lorms of which the activity is such that it cannot
take place without matter, cease to exist so soon as another lorm takes
their place3 a form either actually informs matter or disappears altogether.
When the daisy fades, when the hutterlly or the nightingale dies, their
forms — their souls, in Scholastic language — cease to be. ln man alone,
the form, which is the soul, “that by which the body is a living human
body”‚ has a distinct activity which does not depend upon matter3 and
therefore, when separated, though it is no longer actually a lorm, it need
not cease to exist.

Such is the ordinary doctrine of the School‚ in which we must
notice the appeal to the lact ol change for the positing ol the two
elements, and to the principle of contrariety to prove their distinction from
each other. The thing is matter, partly; it is partly form; but also it is
partly not one, and partly not the other, since each are different. Yet they
are both identical iu space3 where one is, there is the other: lorm pervades
matter, matter upholds' form. This doctrine is not so absurdas some may
think. In the XVIIth century, Leihnitz had a return towards the eud
of his career to this old theory which he somewhere says “has agreat
deal ol truth in it'’; and even in our days a great many Neo-Scholastic
philosophers have elaborated a theory ol Matter and Form, identical in
its essentials with the ancient one, but strictly agreeing with the data ol
