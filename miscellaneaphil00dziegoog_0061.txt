LIV . INTRODUCTION.

obliterated. The first: “Magistri johannis Huss unus tractatus de ydeis‘'
can still be seen fairly distinctly, but the following “secundus’' (according
to budik and Stephens) happens to come just on a lold of the parchment3
and waS, to me at least, quite indecipherable even with the aid ol a
powerlul lens. Alter this word, which we may — on the joint authority
oi budik and Stephens — take to be “secundus'', follow two more,
which are still fairly legible “replicacio universalis'’. The third line begins
with a word which seems to me just as likely to be ‘eius‘ as tercius,
though perhaps Ι should adopt the latter lor preference. Then comes
something illegible which falls just on the above-mentioned sold, That
one os these words is ‘de’ may possibly be admitted, at least by any
one who has been led to expect to see that word there. The upper
part of one letter is quite plain and may well belong to a ‘d’. The last
word is still legible.

But it is clear that Dudik’s statement that both ‘tercius' and ‘eius'

are to be sound here cannot be correct (Stephens reads only ‘eius').

For some trace, even isit were illegible, would certainly exist, isa second
word had been written there, but no such trace is to be seen. After
‘replicacio universalis’ these is not a sign ol any other word but ‘tercius’
(or eius), and aster it we have directly “deveris universalibus''. In these
circumstances it will be safest not to let this old and very obscure anno-
tation have any preponderating influence on the question ol the authorship
of any ol these treatises.

With regard to the second treatise, Dudik disputes, and 1 think
with reason, the claim ol Huss to its authorship. He summons to the
support os his view, neither the circumstance that this work os Huss has
been hitherto unknown, nor the fact that Lewis in his “History os the
lile and opinions of John de Wycliffe’' (Oxlord 1836) resers to this
treatise as one ol Wyclil's most important works, but bases his contention
on the ground that the omission ol words and phrases in this as well
as the other three treatises which are with all reason ascribed to Wyclil,
implies the unlamiliarity of the writer with the original. This evidence he
thus brings lorward: „Wenn man bedenkt, dass der Autor, wenn er sein
Concept mundirt, kaum nothig hat, Woite, die er nicht lesen kann, aus-
zulassen — denn wer soll ihm hierliber Auskunft ertheilen? Man aber in
dem, dem Huss zugeschriebenen Tractate „De Ydeis” solche ausge-lassene
Stellen, ja eine sogar mit einer spateren Schriit eingesetzte antriflt3 dann
