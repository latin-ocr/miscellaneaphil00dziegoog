We might easily show how such doctrines work. in the fields ol
Law and Ethics. Obligation‚ punishment, goodnesS, virtue, and so forth,
become at most the merest fabric ol our hrains. The Artful Dodger is
not sent to prison lor having picked a pocket. No, indeed: in so sar as
this is an abstract statement, in so sar it is false. He cannot be sent to
an abstraction sor having picked — an abstraction! .He is sent, say, to
the Old Bailey sor picking the right eoat-tail pocket ol Mr. So·and-so‚
on such a date. Still less can we say that picking pockets is an offence
punishable by imprisonment, unless we mean this to referto and symbolize
a number ol cases like the preceding case: otherwise it is a mere ideal
proposition, good sor nothing. Now, as a summary‚ merely symbolizing
cases that have occurred in the past, it has no value whatever as
concerns the present or the future: and the whole binding power of
Law is thus swept away! The same is true as regards morality. I ought
lo do this remains indeed, il we mean thereby an individual feeling os
obligation on some special occasion3 but try to lay down rules ol
conduct - even to Nelson’s famous signal: ‘England expects every man
to do his duty’ ·- and they vanish into thin air. ΙΙ duty could be done,
an abstraction would be really existing in the act by which it is done.
And yet English sailors did their duty at Trasalgar - let Conceptualists
explain the lact how they may.

ΙΙΙ have exposed these absurdities at such length, it is because
the reader must see all Wyclil’s reasons sor choosing the contrary
alternative. Perhaps I shall therefore be excused if, at the close os this
long investigation, Ι look sor a moment at the humorous side ol these
theories. Yon are very sharpset, and enter a restaurant in a hurry. A
waiter ol the Nominalist persuasion (Heaven save the markl) comes at
your call. “1 want a grilled steak, you say‘'. “Beg pard0n‚ sir, you
don't; there is no such thing in the world. What you want is the

particular grilled steak ol which you are thinkingf'. — “l am thinking

ol none in particular,” you protest3 “any steak will do sor me’'. “Excuse
me, sir‚” he replies; “any steak will nol do; any sleok is only a word”.
You leave the place, blessing theman, and go to another restaurant,
where another walter (a Conceptualist this time) politely assures you
that what you want, not being something concrete and determined‚ is
merely your general idea ola steak, which he regrets that he cannot
supply, there being only singular steaks in the house. “Then give mea
