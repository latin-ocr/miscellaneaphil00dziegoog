XXIV AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

doubted; at all events they understood that the substance 01 the bread
remained, and was the figure 01 Christ’s body. Into the justice 01 the
sentence I need not enter, being only anxious 10 show that our philosopher
was neither inconsistent nor a eoward3 that his assertions harmoniae
from his own point 01 view with one another, and were merely the
lrank statement 01 his matured thought

But Wyclif did not at the outset see the necessary consequences
to which his system led. At first 116 saw nothing to hinder him 110111
maintaining the general opinion 01 the School, as above set lorth. Later,
when he still admitted the possibility 01 annihilation, he held that the
subtle reality 01 space existed where that which previously was bread
had ceased to be3 a corpus mathematicum, miraculously sustaining the
accidents 01 shape‚ colour‚ resistance‚ etc. ln the course 01 discussion,
it dawned upon him that space, t0 be consistent with his own view,
could no more exist independently 01 the matter which occupies it than
the shape 01 a waxen ball can remain when the hall is destroyed.
Whilst yet uncertain, and inclined to think that the subject 01 the
remaining accidents was mere entity⁷ or an essence concerning the
nature 01 which ‘he is not curious to enquire‘‚ 116 entered the third

stage, as shown in a most instructive passage 01 De Benedicta Incar-
natione. And at last, deciding that matter cannot be annihilated‚ he came

to the irrevocable conclusion that ‘what we see, is bread3 what we
adore, is Christ's Sacramental Body‘.

Ι shall possibly be expected to draw a parallel here between
Wyclii and Luther. But there is no parallel to draw. Luther may srom
other points 01 view have been far superior to Wyclil; as a philosopher,
he is nowhere beside him. What attempts at metaphysical reasoning are
to be found in his works clearly proceed 110111 the necessity to buttress up
some newly built theological doctrine. Wyclif’s theology is the reverse3 it is
mostly the mere outcome 01 his metaphysical creed. Wyclil was above
all a logician; few great men have been so illogical as Luther, And whereas
Wyclif approached the door 01 exit 110111 the Churcb with slow reluctant
stepS, urged onwards by necessity gradually made clear to him, Luther,
exasperated by opposition as much as by 01111363, went over the threshold
in a lew great strides. One was a philosopher; the other was not.

Having stated at the outset that I personally do not agree with
the theories expounded in this article, I may be blamed 101 1101 giving
