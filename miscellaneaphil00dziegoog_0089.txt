LXXXII lNTRODUCTlON.

difficulty might be urged farther. For, unless our authvr is inconsistent
here, ‘mere intelligibility’ of which he speaks is but an unintelligibility.
And if the Universal Man is independent of each and all of his singulius,
and is something really existing, is he not real from all eternity? Here,
Ithink‚ Wyclif could hut admit the conclusion, saying however (asl
previously supposed) that in so far as this universal exists anteriorly to
its singulam, it is the ldeal Man, not essentially other than God; and
that the same, as existing in its singulars, is distinct from God. This
would explain his remarkable statement on p. 239, that “he cannot go so
for as to assert the identity of all things with God, since he would risk
being misunderstood'’; and when he denies (on the same page) that any
'creature exists eternally‚ he evidently means ‘in so far as it is a creature,

singular, and restricted to being at some moment of time’. In so far as

it is identical with its Universal‚ which abstracts from all time, and has
been from all eternity willed by God, it exists otherwise: and in so far
it is not a creature. Our author, as we see, is able by this distinction
to affirm in one sense that no creature is God, and in another to say -
though he tells us he ‚does not think himself justified in affrrming this -
that every being is God, “concedendo asinum et quodlibet nominabile
esse Deum‘'.

Such is the treatise De materia et Forma, in which we plainly see
the principles laid down in Logica now worked out to very startling
conclusions. It was already easy to perceive in the former work how
' nearly Wyclif's system approaehed to the Pantheism of the old Realists3
here the resemblance becomes much more striking. He never, it is true⁷
declared himself a Pantheist openly3 and his boldness was such that, had
he believed his system led to it, the declaration would no doubt have
been made, But his subtility was as great as his boldness, and he probably
found in his distinction grounds for holding back, which, inadequate though
they might have seemed to other minds, were amply sufficient to his own.
Others may have thought him a Pantheist3 he certainly held, from first to
last, that he was not.
