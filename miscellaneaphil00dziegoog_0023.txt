the world and of space is out of the question. ln this immobile spherical
space, real yet of subtle essence, made up os an immense multitude of
points, each touching the other, our material universe which consists oi
punctal atoms in number equal to the points oi space, and each sitting
exactly into the point which is its site at any time, revolves in the
number of instants, known to God alone, that make up the twenty-four
houm. And as points are the srrst elements of space, atoma, ol matter,
and instants‚ ol time, so the instantaneous passage of a material atum
from one point to the next, is the first element of movement.

But how can we picture to ourselves indivisible points which,
though touching one another, do not coincide? When an atum passes
from one site to the next, there is no distance between: how can that
he called a'passage? Τ he same difficulty recurs as to time. We cannot
imagine two indivisible instants without any interval between them.

These objections, which our author states and solves at great length,
together with many others that I must *needs set aside, had no doubt
far more weight in his time than they ought to have in ours. A generation
that seriously discusses a Fourth Dimension, or the possible curvature
ol a straight line, should be far more willing than Wyclis's Oxford
contemporaries, whose mathematical education was on strictly Euclidian
lines, to listen savourably to his great plea: ‘What we cannot realize in
imaginatiun is not necessarily untrue’. Mathematics are based on our
impressions and imaginings, both sense-born. When we reason about
essences that transcend imagination, this science naturally fails to bear
us out, and our conclusions may seem to contradict it, though they do
not¹ — Compare this with the argument os such as maintain that a
Fourth Dimension is possible. ‘We exist in three dimensions only, and
so neither sense nor imagination can realize a fourth: but that does not
mean that a Fourth Dimension is absurd'. Is this reasoning be tolerable,
why should we think worse of the other?

Our author, moreover, is not content with solving objections: he
brings direct demonstrations to prove his theory, Though modal and
dependent upon substance, every volume in space is real, as has been
shown; so all that really belongs to it is real ton. A surlace, whether
interior 0r exterior, is therefore real; so is a line, so is a point. A line
is a universal, of which its points are the singulars. Take away all its
singulars from a universal; what remains? Nothing. Then how, ill suppose
