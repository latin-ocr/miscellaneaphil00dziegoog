XVIII AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

beginning of another occur at the same instant exactly‚ whenever change
takes place. Supposing then in a moving body two degrees ol speed,
A and B, that succeed each other: Ais a speed os 60 miles an honr
only, B a speed of more than 60 miles- then the last instant at which
A is truly predicated ol that mobile is the srrst at which it is not thus
truly predicated. Alocomotive at the same instant goes only so last
and yet it goes saster! Surely no contradiction could he more palpablev
Another example is probably yet more striking. Hardly any change can
be conceived greater than that which takes place at what is called the
‘instant‘ os death. Now, this so-called instant is in reality tivo: the last
oi Life, the sust os Non-Life. Until and at that last moment ol lise, it
is true that the man, though dying, is living; at that moment it is yet
salse to say that he is dead. But, ‘He is dead’, becomes true immediately
afterwards. The former instant is not the latter, though there is no
possible interval between them. And as it is evident that in every change -
though not so apparently - there is the same succession ol distinct,
yet immediate, instants, and as we know that the duration ol everything
real is a reality, it follows that those indivisible elements ol duration
are also real.

How then, in this theory, are we to conceive movement as taking
place? As the infinitesimal instantaneous passage uf one punctal atom
from the site which it occupies to the next, its former site never
remaining empty, but being at once and of necessity filled hy the next
punctal atom. What is called a slow continuous motion is continuous to
the senses only, it consists of a multitude of instantaneous hut infinitely
short leaps‚ with intervals os more or fewer instants os rest between
them. But no atom can move instantaneously through more than one
point, since the instant corresponds to the point. The swiltest possible

continuous movement is at the rate ol one point per instant, when the ⁵

mobile rests nowhere on its way: and this, Wyclif thinks -- following

his heliel in the diurnul revolution ol the universe - is the motion ol
the celestial Equator, outside of which there is no space. The slowest
continuous motion possible is that ol the series os four points which touch
the line ol the poles, These change places only once every six hourS,
each occupying exactly the same site at the end ol the twenty-four.
Itis possible that some may say: “All these notions are mere
lantastic dreams, unworthy ol the serious attention ol anyone who thinks’'.
