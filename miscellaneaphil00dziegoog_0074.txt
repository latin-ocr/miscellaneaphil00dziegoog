INTRODUCTION. LXVII

31 the side-notes, should be read, with Wyclil's prools in support 31 his
thesis, and the adversary's denials aud distinctious; with the adversary’s
prools 31 his own conarer-rhesis, and the distinctions and deuials given

by Wyclil. But we may at least, in this debate, call the reader’s attention

to the weak point on each side, and to the argument best pressed home
and least easily 33133333. 13 this duel 31 thoughts, 11 the report 31 the
debate be fair, each ol the combatants lailed to parry a certain stroke;
and (1 think) both from the same reason: each was wrong to some
extent

On p. 138 we find the writer cornered by Wyclil’s arguments, and
actually making this astounding assertion: “A man cannot exist without
any animated being existing; and yet itis not necessary lor a man to be an
animated being3 lor we can conceive circumstances under which aman is not
an animated being. And thus his being animated is not essential, although
it is necessary, according to his nature, that he be an animated being!''
When such an admission is made, he that makes it must be hard pressed
indeed, and Wyclil certainly scores here. Yet it was due to no weakness
on the'part 31 the adversary; the fault lay in the system. Nominalists
contendcd that every universal term only signified a class 31 existing
objects; 11 they did not exist, the Universal term was void 31 signification
as a lact. A man is an animated being, but suppose only one man to exist,
aud all other animals to be destroyed, what becomes ol the class? It
would exist 33 longer, and theman would not be an animated being,
since there would 33 no others with which he can lorm a class. lt is
necessary that man should be animated, and also a being, but not that
he should be an animated being! At least it is thus and only thus, that
l can understand this answer‚ based upon a wrong and narrow conception
31 classes as composed 31 existing, notos possible members: a conception
which most modern logicians repudiate. Α33 with reason, ior when we
predicate animated 31 any being, we cannot help placing it 13 3 possible
class, whether there be other members or not. But, Wyclil maintaining that
the class exists anteriorly to the existence 31 the animated individual, and
his antagonist conceiving a class only as a multitude 31 similar individuale,
the latter was obliged to deny what seems in reality undeniable.

Wyclil is, 33 the other hand, very hard pressed hunsell in another
part ol the debate. On pp. 143—145‚ we sind him striving to answer

this objection: 11 the Universal is really 333 with its singular, it cannot
