AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF'S PHILOSOPHlCllL SYSTEM. XXV

utterance to any criticisms on the subject. Yet I do not see that any
criticisms ol mine are worth having. Wyclil’s system, and not whatl
think ol it, may possibly interest the public. lt is here set forth3 let
those who care, judge lor themselves, 1 have not taken the partos a
judge, but of an advocate3 aud ol an advocate only in the hope to
render comprehensible the sterce enthusiasm — fierce at times even to
the shedding ol blood -- that so novel and yet so plausible a view of
the universe excited in his days. And, to speak quite frankly, Ι have
yet another reason.

Itis true that both Nominalism and Realism have long been dead,
so lar as concerns the formal matter of their disputes. The issues raised
by them, however, are not dead, and remain to divide - perhaps lor
ever — most if not all philosophers into two classes, auditis with
the class to which Wyclif belongs that Ι am in greater sympathy.

Are things as we know them to be? That which is in our minds -
does it exist in itsels as itis in our minds? Answer yes, and you have
not only Wyclil’s Realism, but Berkeley’s denial ol matter, German
Transcendentalism, and the various shades ol thought of modern 1-
dealists: all belong to the same class ‘To be, is to be perceived;
matter exists as and when we know it; outside ol the knower, it is a
nonentity’. - ‘The Non-Ego is posited by the Ego, and is identical
therewith’. — ‘We have cognizance os an external world only as a
modification ol ourselves; and il it is os rve know it, it is nothing but
this modification’.

To the propounded question, Wyclis's adversaries answered‚ No.
But the same answer is implied in Locke's philosophy, in the Materialism
ol sonte XVlllth century thinkers‚ and in the Empiricism and Positivism
ol our own times. Whilst attempting to six the limits ol the human
understanding, Locke was forced to admit that certain ideas, il not all,
were mere empty abstractions to which nothing corresponded in the
real world, and that, reasoning by their meanS, however correctly, we
were still liable to error, because things may exist otherwise than they
are in‚our minds. Again, to assert that all is matter, notwithstanding
our consciousness ol the abyss between matter and mind - what is
this but to say that what we know, how indubitably suever, may never-
theless be false? Things are not as we know them to be. And the
statement (which would destroy Metaphysics if Metapbysics could be
