as existent, unless srlled at every point ol its (to us) boundless extent
by some corporeal substance The world takes up all space, even to its
unimaginable‚ yet existing limits3 and within space, there is not one of
its points unoccupied by a corresponding point ol bodily substance: so
that a vacuum, whether ol real substance or ol real extension, is as
absolutely impossible as a vacuum ol time. Time, amode os being which
implies changeable duration, also depends on the existence ol the world,
and is inconceivable apart from it. And as the ultimate parts ol space
are real indivisible points, so the ultimate elements ol time are real in-
divisible instauts.

The illustrious Pole ol whom Germans - as is they had not
enough great men ol their own — would lain make a German, and
whose name has been given to our present system ol astronomy‚ was
horn 89 years aster Wyclil’s death. Our author, not being in such
matters in advance os his time, takes the assertion that the whole
universe revolves on its axis once every twenty-four hours as an
established lact: and on this lact he proceeds to build a series ol strange,
though strictly logical inserences. Space, being the ‘whereabouts ol the
world', is necessarily motionless; whereas the world is everywhere in
motion, save along the line ol the poles. lt follows that both space and
the world have the shape ol an immense sphere, perfectly smooth, with
no conceivable Beyond. For is the sphere were not a persectly smooth
and regular surlace - still more, il the world had the shape ol a cube or
a prism - the diurnal revolution would bring the surlace ol the world
out ol space sometimes (which is impossible) and sometimes there would
be empty space out os the world (which is no less absurd). The argument
would, it is true, proceed just as well or a cylinder or a cone revolving
on its axis3 but the lact is, the idea of the universe as a sphere was
theuso deeply rooted in every philosophical mind that the possibility ol
these alternatives did not occur to Wyclil. He goes on to prove that
the universe can be neither larger nor smaller than it is. ll larger, and
space did not expand, a portion ol it would be beyond space3 is smaller,
and space did not shrink, there would be a vacuum: and as we cannot
think away even the smallest part ol space (just as we can add nothing

in thought to its vastness), a simultaneous swelling or shrinkage both ol
