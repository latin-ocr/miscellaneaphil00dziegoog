lNTRODUCTlON. LIII

With regard to the last and longest treatise Ι may say that the
writing differs very considerably from that ol its predecessors. In the first
place it is much more compressed than the others, there being now
ii. e. srom leal 87) from 45 to 47 lines to the page, whereas before we
had ouly 37 or 38. And I must add my opinion to that ol Dudik, that
we should consider this fact as tending to show that this treatise is
written in a different hand from that of the others. Here too we have
written in red, not only the initials, but also the commas and capital
letters in the text, and besides these some of the Bohemian words (for
alist of which, see the appendix) and lastly the following sentence which

precedes the 15¹¹¹ chapter: “Ponam eum super tronum meum''. In great

abnndance too are the corrections, emendations ol a later date and
omissions, sor examples ol which Dudik refers to leaves 96, 109, 111,
119, 120, 126, 130, 132, ¹33·

This treatise is followed by an index, occupying two pages of three
columns each and about hals a column ona third page (leap 135 b),
and finally corne eleven leaves blank and unnumbered.

We now reach the question os the authorship ol these treatises.
There can scarcely be any real doubt, except as to Nos. ll, IV and V,
“De Ydeis'', “Replicacio de universalibus'' and “De veris universalibus‘’.
lt will be remembered that an old note, according to the interpretation
of Dudik, assigns the authorship ol these to Huss. That Wyclil, as the
manuscript itself states - was the author ol Nos. I and ΙΙΙ, must be
considered established beyond all doubt. But that Wyclil — and not HusS,
as this old note is supposed to assert, — was also the author ol N0. V,
is erident from the concluding words nithe Manuscript which Ι have
already quoted: “Explicit tractatus de veris universalibus Magistri venera·
bilis Johannis Wycleph, Sacre theologie veri et magni professoris .....
per manus Huss de Hussinetz.

Dudik advances the very arbitrary, but at the same time ingenious
hypothesis that this old annotation on the cover is really intended to
mean that Huss was the author ol only Nos. ll and lV. The word
‘tercius' in that case would be an error ol the pen, and the treatises
ascribed to Huss would be “Tractatus de Ydeis and Replicacio unirer·
salis eius de veris universalibus'’. But with respect to this I must observe
that it may be considered quite an open question whether Dudik has
correctly interpreted this old note. The words are now to a great extent
