ΑΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF'S PHILOSOPlllCAl. SYSTEM. XXIII

Now the Real Presence, in Wyclis's system, made no difficulty
whatever. Christ’s Words‚ ‘This is my body’, spoken by the everlasting
Truth, made that Presence true for all consecrated hosts, thencelorth to
the end os time. Nothing is true but what really exists at some Nona·
Christ's Presence was therefore real, aud coincides with the consecration
ol each Host. But, according to the system that we have expounded‚ a
material body cannot exist without occupying certain fixed points of
space, and thus being extended. lt is only as a Universal Reality that
anything can be one in many; and it is only as figured by the bread
that Christ’s Body can be present entire in every part. ‘'rhis, this,
this particle oi bread is really the figure os Christ’s Body‘, exactly
corresponds to: Ἀ, Β, C is a man! Thus the bread posses from
being a purely material substance to being a singular oi the Universal
‘Figure ol Christ‘, which bas real entity; and it is in this sense that
Wyclil admits both the Real Presence and Transubstantiation.

But, does the bread cease to exist? That were a sheer impossi-
bility. We have already seen that space, created together with the
world, is necessary at every point ol its extent. Should a single atom,
at the instant when another moves out ol its site into the next, fail to
replace the vacated site, the site — as it must be the sile os something —-
would exist no longer; which is absurd. How much more absurd is
then the hypothesis that the multitudinous atoms which make up the

smallest morsel ol bread, can be annihilated! This is the true reason

why Wyclil so strenuously denies that accidents can be separated srom
their substances: if they did, they would be sustained either by an
impossible vacuum, or by another substance having accidents ol its own.

Thus the bread remains; but we may no longer look upon it as
bread, since Christ has told us what it is now. To the eye os saith,
its material being is as nothing compared with the supernatural entity
which has been added thermo, and which is in all truth worthy ol our
adoration. Α bit os gloss, plunged in the sun’s rays, appears to our eye
as a bit ol light, not ol glass: and such should be the attitude ol our
mind towards the Holy Eucharist.

Such a doctrine, notwithstanding Wyclil' s masterly deience in
Convocation, could not fail to he condemned as an error, unless his
ecclesiastical judges had been Realists, and moreover‚ Realists in his
sense oi the word. Whether they lully understood him or not, may be
