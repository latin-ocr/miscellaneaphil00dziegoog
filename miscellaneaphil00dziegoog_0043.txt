by which this act also is enabled to reach it? and another again without
end? or none at all? Besides, the doctrine implies that the soul erentes
and annihilates its own act when, alter eliciting it, it passes to another.
For the act is an absolute entity which does not pre-exist in matter,
and is nowhere when not actually in the mind. No lorm but the human
soul has the absolute entity ol a separahle thing, since no other can
be conceived as existiug unless actually determiuing a subject, and
separation would be tantamount to annihilation (p. 5-8). Itis said that
these acts naturally depend on their subject, but that Gud might, by a
miracle, render them independent. But that would make all dependency
ol effect upon cause amere accident3 lor, independently ol any cause
. but the First, any effect might take place, and this is unphilosophical
in the highest degree. Better say that when these acts are produced
they are created, and annihilated when they cease: though this would
make substances ol them (p. 8). Il any actis capable oi seli-existence,
how can it be successive in its essence? Yet many mental acts are
admittedly such; sensations, lor example, imaginations, and many others
(pp. 9› ¹⁰)-

Can it be said, to explain the difficulty, that one act sulfices lor
the perception of successive things? or that a fresh complex act is
elicited at every instant ol perception? or that there are simultaneously
two distinct acts, one successive, and the other not? - Students ol that
portion ol Philosophy which lies on the border between Psychology and
Metaphysics, will here recognize the interesting question, How can we
apprehend succession, il there be nothing permanent in our acts? T. H.
Green, for instance — l quote the words ol the President of the
Aristotelian Society (address, 6¹¹¹ Nov. 1899) — “continually reiterates
the statement that the apprehension ol succession cannot be itsell
succession; that in order to be aware olB as succeding A, we must
have both A and B belore consciousness at once”. Wyclii‚ it is true,
brings this question lorward only by way ol argument against his
opponents; but the very same difficulty stands in the way ol those who

admit no subject, or a subject which is nothing but a series ol succes-
sive acts.

One act, il it be a thing, cannot be successive3 and il not succes-
sive, cannot represent succession. lt would represent what is past or
future as present,¹ i. e. otherwise than it is, and salsely. And if we can
