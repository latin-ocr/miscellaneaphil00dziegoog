LXXII INTRODUCTION.

author — is quoted at length in De Materia et Forma (p. 171). Resides,
the works of Wyclif himself are quoted or mentioned, alwayS, as usual
with him, without saying whose works they are; so much sn, that in
De Actibus Anime his allusion (p. 12) to libro tercio without any mention
of the author would naturally lead usto suppose he is speaking ofa
work of his own. De Ydeis, De Trinitate, De Benedicta Incarnacione,
De Tempore, and De Universatibns, are all spoken of as either already
known or as about to appear: and this last is no doubt the strongest
proof of authenticity that can be given.

As to the date, we may fix it approximately by the tractates above
mentioned. All save De Benedicta Incarnacione are referred toas already
written3 this one alone is to come. Now Mr Hamis, in his Introduction
to this work, gives an extremely ingenious argument to assign for its
appearance one of the years between 1363 and 1367. De Materia et
Forma came before it, and the whole Samma de Ente before that, since
Wyclif refers to treatises in the Summa, and evento some of the treatises
which stand last upon the Vienna list, De composicione Hominis, from its
references (pp. 10, 14) to De Universaltbns, must have been written after
that treatise, and also, in all probability, after the Samma· and as itis
the development and application of the doctrine contained in De Materia
et Forma, it was most likely written after it. De Ente Predicamentati is
certainly posterior to the Samma, from which it quotes, but I have found
in it no quotation either from the present treatise or from De Composi-
cione Hominis. If we admit Buddensieg’s date of 1362 for that of Wyclif’s
denial of annihilation (towards which our author near the end of Logica
is evidently strongly inclined> these works come in the following order,
so far as I can judge (1) The ten long tractates of the Samma de Ente.
(2) De Ente Predicamentati. (3) De Materia et Forma. (4) De Composi-
cione Hominis; and (5) De Benedicta Incarnacione; not to speakof the
Questiones 13 which seem to have belonged to an earlier period. lt seems

impossible for aman to have written so much in less than five years;
therefore, if 1367 be really the latest date for De Incarnacione‚ I would
also incline to think it not far from the earliest, aud since De Composi-
aione Hominis and De Materia et Forma are both short treatises, to
suppose them written one year before; let us say, in 13660r1365. And
even that would give us only four or five years for his immense work
De Ente together with the one that immediately followed it. This outpour
