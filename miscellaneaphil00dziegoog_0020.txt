ΑΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF'S philosophicae SYSTEM. XIII

theone is certainly not his being the other. You take a cup ol tea,
and experience a taste at once bitter and sweet3 it is one sensation‚
and yet you distinguish the bitterness lrorn the sweetness. Brielly, in
nature we are continually meeting with instances oi two things that are
identical with a third, and yet differ from one another. Even the mathe-
matical concept nithe whole and its parts would be impossible, ii we
denied this. The whole is identical with all its parts, and to some extent,
with every one of them: each part is distinct from every other, and no
part is anything that the whole is not.

Thus, though humanity is every individual man, one individual is
not the other. Animation is common to brutes and men3 neverthelcsS,
no brute is a man. No confusion results from the admission that the
same universal Life vivisres both animals and plants. That which is God
is a creature, since Being is the same in both3 yet no creature, as a
creature, is God.

Let us now, after this first glimpse at wyctit' s system, go back
five hundred years and look into our young philosopher's mind, as aiter
some sbarp struggle with his lile-long antagonistS, the Franciscan s

Nominalists, be walks out into the country round Oxiord to soothe his

tired brain with quiet musings. The mystery of the Holy 'l‘rinity, oi
which his doctrine multiplies vestiges throughout creation, is everywhere
and always present to him. ‘Neither contounding' the individuale, ‘nor
dividing’ their essences, bis glance at once takes in the outward diversity
ol things, and the unity which underlies it. The sky is azure‚ the lsis
which rellects it is azure, the forget·me·nots upon its banks are azure3
and yet they are not three azureS, but one azure. The plough-boy whom
be sees alar has bodily existence, the oxen moving under the goad
have the same corporeity, the glittering ploughshare is corporeal too:
each is other. but their corporeity is One. 'l‘he light which lalls on the
landscape is an entity, the landscape lit thereby is also an entity; so is
the movement of the rolling water, and so likewise is the water that
rolls: vast as the distance between them ie, both phenomena and
substances share one Universal in common. And this Entity is the same
with that of the hlost High. 'lhe truth oi their present mobile existence
was as real in God before the world began, as it is now, the lact that
ut iltis point os time they exist, nerer was, never will be salse; lle
