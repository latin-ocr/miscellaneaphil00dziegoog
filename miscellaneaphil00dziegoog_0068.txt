lNTRODUCTlON. LXI

because the great expenditure of time consequent upon the difficulty of
deciphering the MS, with its obscurities and numerous abbreviatione, has
frightened would-he investigators from attempting the task.

The interest which I feel for the work has led meto make a
genuine attempt to decipher that one of the frve treatises of the MS. which
has secmed to me most likely to repay mc for my pains. Ι was inllueuced
in my choice, partly because this particular treatise is a reputed original
work by Huss, which gives it aspecial interest, and partly because of its
shortness, and furthermore hy the fact that the “replicacio de unirer-
salibus” is the only one of the five contained in the Stockholm MS. which
seems to be unique. As far as l can learn, no other library in Europe
possesses a copy ol this treatise.

May I conclude by hoping that my work will be looketl upon as a
small and humble contribution towards the realisation of the great and
noble task which the Wyclif Society has undertakcn?
