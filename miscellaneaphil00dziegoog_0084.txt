igneity, petreity, and humanity are substantial forms, ‘this view, as we see,
is not based upon the idea ol substantial change, nor ol a part ol the
substance remainng, while the other disappears. ln a man there is nothing
but humanity, in wax there is nothing but ‘waxness'; these words denote
the whole being inan abstract way, and that is all. Whereas the Scholastic
doctrine as previously set lorth, calls the soul the form ol inan, because
it gives humanity to the botly3 bnt it is not itsell humanity‚ lor when it
is eparated from the body, the existence ol‘ the man that was censes
Wyclil ridicules this idea ol' a compound ol' form and matter which is,
he says, “like a tunic and its lur''. Such a lorm is absolutely
undemonstrahle3 hot Wyclil's notion ol form can be very readily de-

monstratcd (pp. 179-180). The rest of the chapter is a side-issue with

Acerrimas, who is here accused ol misunderstanding Aristotle.

Ch. al. Objections to the theory are now propounded in order, not
only to answer them, but to decelop the theory itsell‘. lt is said that,
according to lVyclil’s position, all essential differences would be destroyed.
ln his view matter is, in the case ol sire, Thai which possesses igneity;
in the case of man, Thai Which possesses igneity3 and so l‘orth; the ‘lhnt

reality. T hetelore (the adversary arguesi is your Thai Which now underlies
igneity and now humanity, the same essence may he at one time fise, at

that il Thai ulrich is to be called an essetne, it is so in that sense in
which essence abstracts from all differences and limitatione, i. e. in a trans-
cendental sense. Quality is ewrwling that can be said os a subject; il
