was merely adduced as arx illustration. That matter must be identieal
(pp. 203—206) with l'orm because one interpenetrates the other, is an
utterly worthless objection.

Cli. 6. (pp. 266-216) Another argument is discussed here. How can
this ‘created essence’ be lormless and simple? It is prior to its form,
as already stated; yet it cannot exist without it: a flagrant contradiction.
lt is identical with matter, form and compound7 since it is what is common
to all three; but if so⁷ it is threelold and not simple. We may give
Wyclil's auswer very lxrielly, There are various kinds of priority, amongst
which priority in time and origin are most important. A sound is prior in
its origin to the tune ol which it forms a part, yet it is not prior to it
in time, ll primal matter is naturally prior to its form, yet cannot exist
without one, when is it l'ormless? Never‚ in time; but it is lormless at what
Wyclii calls the srrst instant os nature — a mode ol being, not measured
by time. What underlies anything must exist (at least iu its nature) before

that which it upholds. —- As to simplicity‚ the argument equivocates with

the various senses os this term. 'l'he same essence is matter, sorm and
compound‚ i. e, it consists ol these three, just as God consists of the
Three Persons, without ceasing to be perfectly simple. The difference is
in the point ol view you take. The essence of man, ol that which is man,
and os humanity, is one and the same,

Cle. 7. (pp. 216-225) consists mainly oi the same objections as
were given belone, this time answered by an appeal to the Bible and
Augustinc, whose expressions coincide with the theory set forth. lt is not
of much interest, sor the opponent's answer would be ready: neither the
inspired authors nor the Father of the Church intended to write with
Scholastic exactness However, the argument, confirmed by a great number
ol quotations‚ seems to thow that Wyclis's theory agrees more closely
with the letter os Holy Writ. 'l‘wo points may be noted here. One that
Wyclil approves of a theologian, wh0, to avoid sophistical affectation,
would answer simply ves and no to the same questi0n; ol course in
different senses. This, he says, is an affective mode ol reasoning, but
with cavillers only. The other is that our author smds himself contradicted
by Aristotle. The latter says: “A statue is made ol brass; brass is not
made a statue.'' But Wyclis‚ quoting ‘the water that was made wine’, and
Adam who tvos ‘dust’‚ and many other passages ol a like nature, merely
replies that he does not approve Aristotle's dictum.
