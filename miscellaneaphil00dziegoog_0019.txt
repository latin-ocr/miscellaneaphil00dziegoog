XII ΑΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

early followers 01 that line 01 thought fell into a trap which he avoids
with consummate skill. Ἱ1,’ argued their adversaries, ‘Humanity be identical
with Smith‚ and that same Humanity be identical with Brown - then
Smith 0011 Brown are identical! Two things, the same as a third, cannot
but be the 30100 03 each other’, This was granted by certain Realists
010111 times, who averred that the distinction between two men was
only apparent, they being essentially identical. More closely pressed‚ they
were forced to admit that all animale, all living thingS, and smally all
heings‚ were one and the same. Thus they not only 1011 1010 Pantheism
- which in our days 01 1100 thought has not all ¹the practical con-
sequences which it had then -— but they confused all things together,
thus annihilating science and law no less completely than did those that
held the contrary view.

Wyclif was not 10 be caught in this way. He laughs to scorn the
argument brought sorward. 11 ie, he says, not a syllogism, buta monstrous
paralogism. What do you mean by ‘Humanity is identical with Brown?'
Humanity in 11301113 identical with nothing but itsell. Humanity, as in
Brown, is identical with that gentleman. Granted. Humanity, us in Smillr,
is identical with Smith. Very well. But here you have two different ideae,
instead 01 000 ‘middle term'. You point 11131 to Humanity in one man,
then to Humanity in another: this change in your point 01 view is

We must never lorget that, though each singular is its Universal
to some extent, and so is thul tulticlt every umeris, still each is different
from every other. To strengthen this position, Wyclii lays great 011033

illustrate his doctrine. What the Father is, is the Son, is the Holy Spirit.
Yet the Father is not the Son, nor is the Spirit the Father. Christ is
God and man at once3 but His Deity is not 1113 human nature. Such
illustrations must, in those days 01 saith, have rendered him incalculable
service. But, setting thern aside‚ let us choose a lew instances in the
