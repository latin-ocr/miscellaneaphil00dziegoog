'l'he writing is inscribed upon good firm paper ol asomewhat
yellowish tinge. The pagination has been done with red inlr, and is
evidently of the same date as the manuscript itself. The margins are not

. particularly wide, measuring as a rule about half an ineh.¹ 'l‘he

volume contains five treatises, principally of a philosophical and scho-
lastic nature2 The title, which is to be found at the end, is as
follows: - Wiklest tractatus nretlzapysici per atauus Mag Joh. Hus de
an.1398.³

It is very remarkable that an old note on the upper cover appa·
rently assigns the authorship of three of the five treatises to Huss. On
this cover we find srrst in more modern characters No, 9 (referring to
the 1734 catalogue), and then immediately below, the following words
are to be distinguished on the authority of Dudik (Forschungen in

Schweden). “Magistri Johannis Hus onus tractatus de ydeis secundus re·

plicacio universalis tercius eius de veris universalibus” 'I‘hat this old an-
notation (see pp. LIII, LIV) is not accurate seems probable, for several
reasons which I will subsequently adduce.

1 lmay here record some other minor points of interest which l observed during
my study of the MS. I found that the volume, as far as leaf 20, had been performed
by sorno sharp three-edged instrument, which, as far as I can judge. may well have
been a swordpoint. The upper cover is pierced as well, but in the first leaves, which
are evidently a later insertion and one of which is glued to the cover, this little
triangular hole is of course wanting. Can it have been some Swedish soldier who,
intoxicated with victory at the capture of llradschin, thus wished to set with the
point of his sword a conqueror’s mark which should commemorate for ever the
acquisition of this precious document by his countrymeni There are also one or
two other small peculiarities to be noticed. On leaf 108 a coarsp, but characteristic
face has been drawn with black ink iu a large red initial. Ilgziiri, at two or three
places a rather large hand pointing has been drawn, e. g. leaf aih, bya large red
initial, and leaf 78. 2I say t<principally³’, for purely theological subjects are
also treated of. For instance, at the end of the first treatise, sin against the Holy
Ghosl is discussed, and among other things the writer points out the absurdity of
maintaining before a man's death, and without a special manifestation, that he has
been guilty of sin against the IIon Ghost, and on the strength of this assumption
depriving him of the resource and consolation of prayer. ³Dr. B. Dudik
wrougly states in his “Forschungen in Schwedcn fur Mihrens Geschiclrte”, p. 185
that the MS. dates from the year 1389. Possibly this is a misprint, but it occurs

both in the index and text.
