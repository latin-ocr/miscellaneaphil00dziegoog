singular one‚‘' you angrily reply‚ “and have done with it”. A singular,
sir?‘' he says3 “there can be none except in your mind, sir. We have

only this one, that one, and this other’' (pointing to each). “This one

then‚'' you say. “Very well, sir3 now you can be served. But so long
as your craving was for a mere empty abstraction, the thing was
impossible”. — Let us trust that assault and battery would not ensue3
but how far you would be exeusable if it did, l leave my readers
to judge.

lf then both Nominalists and Conceptualists strike at the roots of ¹
seleuce, law, morality, logical reasoning, and that plain common sense
against which no man can go without making a fool of himself, there
ean be no doubt that any general term - man, for instance — means
something more than the letters of the word, something more than the
abstract idea of humanity that we conceive to be identical in both. The
similarity between them that we perceive exists in them beforehand‚ or
we never could perceive it. And it is identical in hott. As the distance
from York to London is absolutely the same as that from London to
York, so the similarity between A and B is the similarity between
Β and A; and, as we have shown, it is no mere idea, but really existing
in A and in B. This, when extended to all men, past, present, or future,
is the Universal Man (or the real fact of their being men) identical with
each individual taken as a man, and differing from them only in that they
are the Many in One, whereas Humanity is the One in Many - one
really existing, though universal, substance. To say therefore that there
are only singulars in the world is a falsehood, leading to the absurdities
enumerated in the foregoing paragraphs

But we ean and we must go further. Men as well as brutes are
animated beings, and - by the same reasoning — there exists a
universal Animation, common to brutes as tn men. Animated beings and
plants have in common the yet more universal Life, absolutely the same
'l'hing in a mushroom and in a man. We must go further still, urged
onward by irresistible logie. Everything we can conceive - both God
and His ereatures - is a being: and thus Being is really identical in
all: a transcendent link, binding the whole universe together, and giving
it unity and harmony.

Such is the basis of Wyclif s system, such is what he sltares with
other Realists. We must now see wherein he differs from them. The
