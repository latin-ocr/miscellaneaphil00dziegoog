(2). Authentieity of the Treatise.

ln Shirley’s catalogue the only reasons given to prove that the work
is Wyclil's are (ι) the author's name in the MS. and (2) the title given
by Bale, but with another incipit. The second is plainly inadequate‚ and
so is the first, as we shall see when we come to examine the authorship
ol Replicalio de Universalibus‚ But there is lar stronger internal evidence
in lavour ol its authenticity. Setting apart the lact that Scripture is much
less quoted here than in most ol the other philosophical treatises (which
may easily be explained by supposing it written at an early date) the
style is Wyclil's, and the ideas are his as well; less marked perhaps
hut plain to anybody who has made a study os his style and system.
The writer shows, besides, the same intimate acquaintance with Gilbert de
la Poree (pp. 2, 39), Alhacen (p. 12). Vitellio (p. 13, 46), Bradwardine
(p. 37) and others, as Wyclil does in Logica and elsewhere. What is
more, he speaks ol himself as intending to expound his doctrine· concerning
truth and lalsehood in a certain ‘first book De insolubilibus’. Now this
is precisely the title given by Shirley to one ol the lost works ol Wyclil
whose first words have not been preserved·² though (p. 28, note) Ι venture
to suppose that it is one ol the tractates in Logica. Itis difficult, in
presence ol all these indications‚ to imagine that a contemporary to Wyclil
existed, equal to him in talem, similar as to mental acquirements and
eruditiori, identical in doctrines, and yet so completely unknown that his
very name has not survived, and his De Insatiabilibus has been ascribed

to the other. Yet that we must assume, il we deny the authenticity of
De Actibus Anime.

(3). Date of the work.

Assuming the authenticity os De Actibus, we are at once able, not
indeed'to give any precise date to this work, but to place it before
Logica to which Ι have (lnt. to vol. 1, p. VII) tried to ascribe the
date ol 1361 circiter. He combats most strongly the doctrine ol absolute

accidents (cap. IV), and yet he nowhere openly denies or seems to
doubt the possibility os annihilation, as he does in Logica. Besides, as Ι
point out in a note (p. 28), it is very likely that the De Ittsolubilihus
he proposes to publish is a tractateos Logica itself. ln Logica, besides,
he goes very completely into the theory of vision, as it was then
