LVI lNTRODUCTlON.

this burnt treatise, it is expressly mentioned that it consisted ol five
chapters, which also agrees with that which forms part ol the Stockholm
Manuscript (see Loserth‚ “Huss and Wiclil”‚ p. 282). '

Recent investigations in England have shown that these writings
which have hitherto been looked upon as mutually independent‚ viz.
‘De tempore’ (= de indiv. temp), and ‘De Ydeis',1 only form a part 01
Wyclil’s great treatise ‘De Ente‘.

‘De tempore’ is in lact ξ 0 01 Work Ι, and ‘De Ydeis’ ξ 5 01
Work II 01 ‘De Ente'. (This Ι owe to Dr. Furnivall and the Report ol
¹the Executive Committee.)

κ We now come to the question 01 100 authorship ο1 No. IV, “Repli-
cacio de universalibus'', which is also supposed by Dudik to be the
work 01 Η1133. Ι must begin by observing that Ι consider Dudik’s suppo-
sition altogether doubtful. Both Shirley, in his “Catalogue 01 100 original
works 01 John Wiclil'' and, following him, Lechler in his great work
“Johann v. Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation” and Vattier
in “John Wyclyff‚ sa vie, ses oeuvres, sa doctrine‘', mention a treatise
with this very title. ‘Repl de univ.' as 000 01 Wyclil’s original works
(Nn. 9 01 100 philosophical writings in Shirley, No, ὁ, 10 Lechler and
Vattier). lt is in the MS. No, 10 in the University Library at Prag⁷ but
032 Ιοον0 had no opportunity 01 comparing it with that at Stockholm,
Icannot 01 000130 01 present offer a decisive opinion on the subject.
But so much at least must be plain, that it is by 00 means certain that
Huss was the author. Dudik advances in support 01 013 view the occur·

reverendus” and “Magister meus'‘.

But these expressions might very well'have been Wyclif’s own,
