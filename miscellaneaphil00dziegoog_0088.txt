INTRODUCTlON. LXXXI

Ch. 8. (pp. 225-234) Another series ol objections is brought up
and answered with great dialectical skill. But the most striking part oi the
chapter, at least in my eyes, is its conclusion. ln the last five lines, Wyclis
openly denies his doctrine ol the Possibles; or at least it seems s0. As
l have pointed out in the essay at the beginning ol this volume, nothing
(according to him) was possible, except what actually exists or will exist
at sometime or other. Itis at the bottom ol his whole system, one ol
its foundation-stones, so to speak; and you have but to read in Logica,
vol ll. p. 86, lines 16—36, p. 87, lines 29-37, and p. 89, lines 1-9,
to sec what his opinion was upon this subject, Yet here he speaks of
possible beings which never at any moment ol time exist! Iconless, when
1 saw these lines, Ι was sorely puzzled. Our philosopher's doctrine was not
so venerable in my opinion that Ι should leel obliged, rather than to charge
him with inconsistency, to declare the passage spurious, as controversialists
are sometimes forced to do when much troubled by a text of the Bible; but
nevertheless l was far from inclined to suppose Wyclis had contradicted
himself. We must however choose between these two altematives and a
third, which Ι prefer. He may have used the word possibiles in the sense
usually employed, either by oversight or in order to be more generally
understood; or in other words, he may have meaut by possibiles things
which he himself considered as impossible. But even this explanation is
open to grave doubts, il we admit the lines as they stand to have been
written by Wyclis. Et posse existere, lor instance, sounds very strangely
when we compare it with the lines in Logica that Ι have quoted.

Cli. 9. (pp. 235-242) lt is lastly objected - and Wyclis very
rightly keeps these most serious charges for the end —- that the con·
sequences ol his theory lead to heresy. Every creature, having intelligible
being that is real, would be coeternal with God. Nothing would come to an
end, but all things would be perpetual. And this reality would mean the
reality of actual, not ol merely possible, existence: thus positing a world,
created indeed, but eternally created, in contradiction to the saith ol the
fhurch, Wyclil's answer is perlectly orthodox; he distinguishes between
actual existence and mere intelligibility. That alone which is eternal of any
creature is its exemplar, which lives eternally in God. And here Wyclis
gives a lengthy exposition os the text of St. John, ch. Ι, Quod sactum
esl in ipso viluerat (according to the ancient punctuation); and this ex·

position is remarkably beautiful. still, one cannot help thinking that the
