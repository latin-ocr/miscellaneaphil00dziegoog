LXXVI INTRODUCTION.

Ch. 2. Here Wyclif treats 01 Ideal forms, which are the patterns of
all things, existing eternally in God. Neither here nor elsewhere hare I
been able to find ont whether the Universal Man — who according to
him exists really and eternally in God, really and temporally in each of
his singulars - is something distinct from the Divine Idea of man, or not.
lt may be that Wyclif considers the pattern to 00 something different
from the reality created according to that pattern3 but then he would have
to admit an eternally created being. Or again, he may have thought that
the Universal Man, quei existing in God's mind, is the pattern of the same,
qud existing in singulars: but then there would 00 00 real difference

between the two. 1 must therefore confine mysell to expounding his

doctrine, as he sets it forth.

There is in God an innumerable multitude of ideal formS, one with
llim in essence‚ though we may think of them as distinct from Him; and
in this sense He is the Fornt 01 all beings He is Himself the Form 01
the Three divine persons, since Deity is common to all Three, and since
the Three Persons are not distinct subjects‚ they are all Three one
infinite Form. But sometimes the term is applied to the Person of the
Worrl. Form emanates from matter, in created things, and the compound
proceeds from both together3 thus the Son emanates from the F ather, and
the Holy Ghost likewise proceeds from them. And tbis Supreme Form is
the exemplar of all things. Conceive the world as a mere receptivity, a
something that by itself would at once flow away into nonentity, and God
present everywhere, giving to all things all their qualities of goodness,
beauty and perfectiori (pp. 170-175). This comparison might easily be
understood in a Pantheistic sense, those perfectioris we sce in the world,
are they not the very perfections of God? But Wyclif here, and indeed
throughout his tite, refuses to admit this conclusion, and we find him
tp. 176) saying distinctly that God “forms outside of Himself and ntukes
the beauty (formositatem) of every creature'’. We may think we see a
necessary Pantheistic tendency in the whole of this doctrine, hut Wyclif
certainly did not see it; and no doubt be understood his own system
better than we.

Oh. 3. Our author here begins to join issue with the School. A sub·
stantial form is, according to him, a form in the widest and most abstract
sense in which the term was used: that by which anything 10 what it is.
