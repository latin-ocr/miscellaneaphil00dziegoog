Here Wyclif answers that, without being a movement, it may be the
cause ol one3 and in a more universal sense, it may be called amove-¹
ment, as a tendency towards something or other (pp. 47-49). “How'’,
it is urged, “could a man elicit the same act or commit the same sin
twice, il that were not a quality, now present in the individual‚ now
absent therelrom?’‘ Here Wyclil simply denies that a man can commit
the same sin twice3 its being committed at a different time makes it
another sin (pp. 49-52). Lastly‚ it is objected that what is in, yet
different from the soul, what determines a change therein by its advent,
and may come and go without the destruction of the same, must be a
quality. These argumente, Wyclil shows, prove only that there is a
bappening by which the soul is modified3 but not that the modification
is something· in itself (pp. 52- 58).

The question discussed in the first chapter of the Second Part is
somewhat out of the lines ol modern thought, and requires a short
explanation. Not as to its connection with the former problems3 every
student ol Wyclil knows that he allows himself a very wide range.
Thus, when writing about mental acts² he conceived himself perlectly

justified in positing theses as to their truth or lalsehood. The explanation
concerns the essential meaning ol the discussion. A proposition is con·

lingenlly true, is, while we admit its correspondcnce to laets, we are
able to conceive at the same time that it might not correspond to them.
lt is necessarily true, il such non-correspondence is inconceivable. The
question concerning propositions as to past lacts thus becomes an in-
quiry whether or not such propositions‚ il true, can be conceived as
true contingently3 il false, as contingently salse. tf, lor instance, it be
true as a lact that Queen Victoria reigned over England, can we
conceive her as possibly not having reigned? ln the preceding essay on
Wyclil⁴s philosophy, Ι have shown that Wyclil understands by the Possible
everything that has taken place, is now, or will take place at some l -
ture time; that and that only. All the rest is impossible, inconceivable,
nlisurd. By that means he closes the door on many a Scholastic dis-
cussion; and to ask what would have taken place if Adam had relused
to eat the apple is to him the same as to ask about the mathematical
consequences of the proposition 2-l-2=4 being salse, or ol a triangle
having four sides. And so lar as Adam is concerned‚ most people would
hardly trouble to contradict him. But as his view extends to all llrings
