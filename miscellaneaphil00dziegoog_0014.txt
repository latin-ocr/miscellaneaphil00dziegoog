his lile? To answer this, we must first state the problem, so lamous of
old (though it now sounds like a puzzle in Grammar or Dialectics) which
Nominalists‚ Conceptualists, and the various schools ol Realists set them·
selves to solve.

There is no doubt that the same names are not always used in
the same sense. Mr. Rochester was a bear; there are many bears in
the Zoological Gardens3 others in the Stock Exchange; there is a Great
and a Little Bear in the sky. We may calla nine-thonged whip‚ or a
meuse-eating animal, or a spiteful woman by the name of Cat. Either a
playiug-card or the ruler of a nation may be a Queen. These terms
are equivocal. But there are cases when the same word, applied to
different objecta means the some. Smith is a man3 Brown is a man
likewise. But the word ‘man‘ meaning the same in both casea, bere
comes the question: The same mnas? To this we have three principal
replica. Nominalista say, ‘The same word’3 Conceptualists, ‘The same
concept, or idea'3 Realists, ‘The same thing’.

ln the theory os extreme Nominalists (ol whom the famous Ockam
was the acknowledged exponent) no general term bas any meaning
whatever, unless applied to its singulars, and so long as it is thus
applied. lt is by itsell a mere empty sound, — a flatus vocis, as he
chooses to call it. We sind that two or more singulars resemble each
other, and we take a general term to classily them according to that
resemblance. Thus used, it has meaning3 not otherwise. There is nothing
iu the world save singulars: when taken apart lrom its singulars, a
general term therefore signihes nothing. Smith is a man3 in so far as

'man‘ significa Smith (consequently a concrete being, quite diverse from

'man' taken to mean Brown) it has signification. ln so lar as it is taken
lor something that is the same in both Smith and Brown, it has none.
We docket singulars with general terms, just as a shop·keeper will
docket various articles with a card, bearing: ‘Price Ἣ. Take the ticket
off the article, and ‘Price osy has no longer any distinct meaning.

Such is the theory. It has nothing save its boldness to recommend
it, and is palpably absurd. lt it were true, what would become ol the
seli-euident distinction, glanced at in the last paragraph hutone, between
equivocal and univocal terms? lt would exist no more. There is a
resemblance, lar-fetched indeed and fictitious, between the Zoological
Garden bears, those in human society, and those in the sky, between
