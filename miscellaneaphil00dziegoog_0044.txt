INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

apprehend one instant 01 what is uot present, why not the whole ol the
Past and the Future? To each successive impression an act must corre·
spond; and thuS, in the shortest possible space 01 time, we should have
an infinite multitude 01 acts. This brings us to the second answer, which
is worth no more than the first. There can be no act without acertain
duration, and these would have none at all. On the other hand, we
should have to conceive the absurdity 01 an infinite number 01 entitieS,
0011001000,- call them what you will, - welling up (from non-
existence. or from the unknown, in the theory 01 those who deny a
Subject3 srom the Soul, in the opinion 01 Wyclif’s opponents) even in
the shortest possible space 01 time. This is contrary to experience
besides3 our mental acts 01 sensation have some degree 01 permanence,
lor when we whirl a brand, we see a circle. To suppose two simul·
tancous acts. one successive and the other permanent, apprehending the
lirst, does not solve the difficulty: for an instantaneous act cannot leel
the successive as successive, and a permanent act, being 01 another
nature, could not apprehend it at all (pp. 10-14). Most 01 these
arguments make against such theories as, at the present day, learing to
hypostatize an abstract Subject, set up the sensation itsell and hypo·
statize it. Perhaps l may in this connection be allowed to quote srom
a paper Ι wrote for the Aristotelian Society (Exlettsion as defined from
lire slundpoin! os experience‚ read the 28⁸¹ May, 1900). “Holding, asl
do, most strongly to the principle that abstractions are not to be ‘hypo-
statized’‚ l say that each 01 these facts [os experience]‚ as such, is
absolutely concrete, or (to use a dialectical term) singular. So much so,
that il we do not admit the existence 01 a concrete - nol an abstract —
subject with which they form a whole, they must be dealt with as separate
individuals. But I as strongly object to the hypostatizing 01 an abstract
lact as to the hypostatizing 01 an abstract subject. There is no such
thing in reality as a conscious state3 there are only this, that, and the
other conscious states, each wholly identical with itself, and not identical
with anything else ..... But they are nol rrnconnecled. Now, ill abstract
from this connection, il 1 disregard the fact that these impressions are

part 01 a lotum 01 experience, I only view them from one standpoint3
and il l then persist in calling them individuals, l hypostatize pure
abstractione 01 my mind. They are 00 longer individuals, so long as
labstract lrom anythiog that they really are’'. This is the very thing
