ΑΝ ESSAY ΟΝ wvctw's PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM. XXI

was necessary, without specifying any distinction3 though to the end he
upheld - whether nominally or with sincere intention, it is hard to
say- the dogma 01 free-will, and our duty to act according to the
law 01 God.

It is easy to see how his theory leads to this consequence,
however slow and unwilling he was to go on so perilous a path. As
we have already noticed‚ nothing is possible - in Wyclii's sense 01
the word - except that which is, at some period 01 time. actually to
occur, andis therefore from all eternity soreknown by God as a luture
truth. All other so-called possibilities are in reality impossible, since it
is God’s everlasting will that they shall never be. In this view, since it
¹ was eternally true that Ι shall at this instant be sitting here, writing this
article, and since the contrary of this is not thinkable, how can my sitting
here be aught but an absolute necessity? Wyclil at first tried to answer
the difficulty by taking the usual distinction. Granted that I am sitting,
it is impossible that I do not sit. This would clearly reduce the
necessity to the kind termed hypothetica13 but in his case it was not
applicable. Other philosophers might have said without inconsistency:
‘To be possible does not mean desinite existence 01 occurrence, but
merely the denial 01 a contradiction in terms. Ol such denials the endless
multitude is known to God, not as separate entities‚ but simply as
whatever will, may, or might be. It is not true as a fact that l am
standing, since I am seated; but it is true that 1 might be standing just
as well’ This 01 000130 was an explanation that Wyclif could not give
without sels-stultification. He accordingly at a later period modified his
answer. lt, he said, ‘God has willed anything to take place, it must

take place 01 necessity. But, since God’s will, though eternal, is 1100

and untrammelled, the necessity lails to be absolute. ‘He might, had He
chosen, willed otherwise'. Here his opponente had him on the hip. ‘That
which God might have willed, but did not — is it something possible
or is itan impossibility? 11 it is possible, your whole system crumbles
to pieces3 il not, you arrive at the absurdity 01 saying that He might
have willed an impossible thing'. To* this there was, there could be, no
satisfactory answer, Wyclif in his last years stood, through his conception
ol possibility, committed to a doctrine 01 necessity as hard and fast as
that to which in our days Determinists stand committed through their
conception 01 Law and Causation.
