Note here with what care Wyclil, though he points out that the whole
theory springs from the question ol the-Eucharist (exquibus tota illa

opinio habet ortum, p. 16), avoids any such digression as he is liable

to in other tractates‚ concerning the Eucharist itself: this reticence is of
importance in seeking the date ol the work.

Starting from the Scholastic axiom: Omne ens est bonum, or Ens
el bontrm convertuntur, Wyclii tries to prove that, as some mental acts
are essentially evil, they cannot be entities. Pain is nothing in itsell but
the perception ol disagreement‚ which is nothing positive3 and lying is
essentially evil (pp. 20, 21). The adversaries reply that such acts are
not naturally, but only morally bad: and if a given act did not belong
to a subject, its wickedness would disappear. But if they, belonging to
a subject, render that subject evil, it must needs be because their nature
ishad. Apoint that Wyclif does not develop here, is that qualities
which aflect the will are essentially either moral or immoral‚ and the
distinction between moral and natural badness does not hold in their
case. Now the adversaries held that the same act, elicited by one man,
may he moral, and immoral is elicited by another, so that this is a
mere accident. But, says Wyclif, what about an act ol hatred ol God?
Can God Himself attach merit to that? And besides the supposition ol
an act elicited by no one (not belonging to any subject), ol a pain that
is actual yet suffered by nobody‚ ol something which exists as a pure
potentiality and like a habit — as v. g. a man may actually be a
drunkartl, though not actually drunk - and yet is an act, are so many
absurdities. A mental act signihes something elicited by a subject, or
we should have an endless series ol entities by which the actis pro-
duced, one producing the other, and none ol them really active. And
lastly‚ the supposition ol an act that may be inactive‚ or only potentially
ruthe, is utterly conlusing3 such an act might possibly exist before the
man who elicits it is born (pp. 21 -27).

The following arguments may be more summarily indicated, as
presenting less actual interest in our time3 and l shall throughout attempt
to keep to this rule, as the side-notes are sufficiently explicit to help
any one interested in old-world modes ol thought.

Seli-existence is contradicted hy the essential attributes at least ol
stirne mental acts, Some may be contingently salse or contingently true3
hut il false or true by themselves, they would be so necessarily.
