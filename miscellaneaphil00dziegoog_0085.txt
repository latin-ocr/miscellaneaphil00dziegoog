LXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

Essence that is identical with the Father and the Son, who are themselves
distinct Persons3 the Word that is God and Man at once, although Deity
is not humanity3 and Universal Humanity‚ which is identical with Peter and
with Paul, though Peter and Paul are different individuals. Thereiore, if
Isay: ‘This same essence will be sire and will he watcr’, it does not
follow that sire will be water. Wyclil then goes on to examine various
changes² a discussion into which we need not enter, since his system
explains all oi them except Transuhstantiation, and he admits that there
is here a question which he has not yet solved. Had he admitted that
his Suhject had a merely logical existence, there would have been no
dilsrculty here at all. That which roas bread is Christ's Body. Thai which,
the subject oi the change, remains ol course, even in the orthodox
explanation, but it is a mere word that stands, now ior¹ bread, now ior

Christ’sBody. But wyclis, in his Realism‚ was constrained to give the

sentence the following signification: That ideuiicaiiy same real thing which
was bread is the Body ol Christ. And the Church had decided that
nothing remained ol the bread save the outward appearances. Could these
he taken as the underlying subject? Was the subject merely the same
space, occupied by the appearancesl and isso, could he grant that the
space had a real existence of its own, without coming into conflict with
the Church? No wonder that at this stage Wyclii avoided the discussion,
and said: “Est longus sermo, et adhuc mihi inscrutabilis” (p. 186-189).

The rest ol the chapter (pp. 189—196) is devoted to a discussion
os mention, in the course ol which Wyclii says that the essence of things
existed before the things themselves (an assertion that he will explain
and justify further on); oi the objection that, the receptivity ol matter being
a perlection, the subject cannot be conceived as lormless, to which he
replics that bare receptivity ol anything cannot be a form, since a form
must determine a subject to he this or that in particular3 and oi the vestiges
os the Trinity in creation. We now see clearly that anything sor which
a concrete term is made to stand, v. g. man, horse, trec, is in ¹Wyclif's
theory, the complete substance. What answers to the corresponding abstract
terms, humanity, ‘equinity', ‘arboreity', is the form. And ihai which is
either a horse, or a man, or a tree, is the subject or matter, which may
be identically the same in each successively‚ as it is the same in nature
lor all oi them simultaneously. And ii we are yet more curious to know
what this matter may be, we shall find, on reverting to Logica, that it is
