lNTRODUCTlON. LXIX

holm MS. The MSS. Prag. Univ. 8. F. 1. and 8. G. 6 have already been
described in De Composicione Hominis.

The MS. 4. H. 9. of Prague University is bound in wooden boards,
with a strong leather back. Its size is abont six inches by ten. The
pagination is rather faulty; it extends from f. 1 to f. 262. The MS. is of
perper, only the first and last outside leaves being of parchment, with half-
eflaced copies of Latin verses, some of which apparently relate to the
irregular verbs. The words Pomoz myro haze (Help me, O God) written
in themian over an erasure, sufficiently indicates the country of its
origin.

On the inside cover is an old index of contents; a newer one has
been inserted between the cover and the first (parchment) leaf. After the
parchment there is one blank leaf that is not paginated. De Universalibus
(i. e. the treatise which is part of De Erite) follows from f.1 to f. 52 b.
as io Sbirley’s catalogue, not to f. 56 b, as marked in the MS. table of
contents. The writing is bold, legible, and probably belonging to the
carlier years of the 15 th century; and the corrections are both numerous
and carefully made. There are two columns to every page. The chapters

are indicated, not only by red initial letterS, but by numbers as well. De

Materia ef Forma (beginning on f. 52 b, the number immediately following
being f. 57 — an error of course - and ending f. 73 b a). De Corn·
positione Hominis (ff. 7 3 bato 93 ab) and De Tempore (ff. 94 a to 115 b)
are also written in the same hand and bear a strong externa} resemblance
to each other. Between the two latter tracts there are, besides the verso
of f. 93 b, seven unpaginated leaves. On f. 93 b and the first of the
following leaves we sno several sentences, beginning with omnir senix esi,
in another and a sprawling hand3 these are probably students' notes. Agiria,
after f. 113 b, corne four unnumbered pageS, covered with metaphysical
figures and diagrams, probably in the same band which made the students'
notes. On f. 114 we have the treatise De Ydeis, written in the first hand,
apparently3 but now there is only one column to each page; and this is
also the case with the tract by St. Thomas, De Encinm erirlifafe‚ which
follows from f. 130 b to f. 137 a. F. 137b and one unnumbered page
(leasb that follows contain a prayer in German, probably in the second
‘the student’s) hand. to the Blessed Sacrament. lt begins: “Heiligcr Gottes
leichnarn ich sog’ dir Lob . ‚ .’' From f. 138 to f. 193 wc have an anti·
Wyclifftnn work, Confra universalia realia; it begins with: “Probleuma
