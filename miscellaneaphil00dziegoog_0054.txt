municate with Pastor Lundstrom iu order to induce him to change or at
least shorten part 01 his Introduction, It was in vain; my letter was

ln these circumstances, 1 11011 110 alternative but to print the whole 01

his Introduction as he wrote it; this has 01 course been done with
Dr. Furnirall's approval; and as this Introduction deals mainly ii not ex-
clusit·ely with the Manuscript, its place is naturally here, What 1 shall

important point, 01 contradiction, will come well enough under the head-

tant place. This precious Bohemian relic, now nearly 500¹ years 0111,
was part 01 1110 rich booty 01 1101, which the Swedes, under General
Klinigsmark, succeeded in making at the capture os Hradschin in Prague
on July 21)ΙΙΙ 1048, ou which occasion the art and treasure·chamber 01
the 10101 1101000, as well as its valuable library, lell into the hands 01
the inrailers.² ‘l'he manuscript very probably belonged to the so-called
Rusenberg Library, 0 division 01 the Royal Bohemian Library, 11 the
evidence on this point is correctly interpreted. 11 001110 - together
