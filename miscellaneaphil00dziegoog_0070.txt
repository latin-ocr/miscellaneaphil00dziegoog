INTRODUCTION.

At the end of the eighth (leaf 74):
“rosumyej”.
And after “Explicit ..... Vycleph'':
“0 Wycleff Wycleff negednomu ty hlawu zwycless’' i. e.
“O Wiclif‚ Wiclif upon many hast thou exercised witl”
lV. 111 the Fourth Treatise: “Replicacio de vniversalibus” are no
Bohemian words,
V. In the Fifth Treatise “de veris universalibus‘’ occur the following:
At the end of Ch. 3 (leaf 94) in red ink:
“Za zlaty stogy czos slyssal” i. e.
“What thou hast heard may be priced in gold’.
Before Ch. 5 (leaf 95l in red:
“hurtyk’'.
Before Ch. 8 (leaf tozl:
“haha niemczy haha” i. e. “Haha‚ Germans! Haha!'’
Before Ch. 11 (leaf 116);
“znamenay czos slyssal” i. e. “Mark what thon hast heardl’'
Before Ch. 13 (leaf 124):
“Myly Wycleph dayt boh nebeskc krulewstwye’' i. e.
“Dear Wyclif, may God give to thee the kingdom of heavcnl’'
111 Ch. 13 11111126) in the fourth sentence “quando sit distiuccio”
after the word “arguenda'’ is written in red ink
“hrdyna''¹ i. e. “hero”
but it has apparently no connexion with the text. Lastly at the end of
this treatise and of the MS. (leaf 134) after the words “Explicit. ,81c,”
is added in red ink:
“Amen tak boh day” i. e.

“Amen‚ may God so grantl''

(2). Authentleity and date ottho work.

As we see, Pastor Lundstrdm comes to the conclusion, on one
hand, that it is very doubtful whether Replicacio de Universalibus was
written by HuSS, and on the other that “it is quite credible'’ that Wyclif
wrote it. 1 must for my own part and without the slightest doubt assert

¹'lhus the MS. Dr, Dudik has wrongly “hrdinu‘’.
