ceptualistic theory. The likeness is then only in the chemist’s mind.
What we think os as hydrogen in one jar may in reality have nothing
similar in nature to what we think ol as hydrogen in another. We put
them together, we class them under one general idea; but all our
reasonings must necessarily relate, not to them, but to the ideal Between
things and our ideas ol things, there is an abyss. Science may tell us
something about the latter; about the former, nothing. Experiments may,
lor example, show us that what is in jar No 1 is combustible in exaetly
the same way and under the same conditions as what is in jar No 2,
This is therefore a property identiral in each case, Yesl but the identity
goes no larther than our minds: they are in fact two different combusti·
bilities, and we can asstrm nothing about them, everything about our
ideas ol them. Let Chemistry, Natural Science, MathematicS, all go
to ruin: lor most certainly, when we say, ‘These gases are hydrogen,'
or, ‘These animals are elephants', or, ‘These figures are rectangles'‚ we
do aot mean only: ‘My idea of gas in this and this case corresponds to
my idea ol hydrogen’3 nor, ‘The concept ol certain animab, A, Β, C...
is included in that ol elephants’3 nor, ‘These singulam, which 1 classis ’
as figures, may also be classihed as rectangles'. No: we mean more;
we say not only that the thoughts, but also the things, have in them-
selves a correspondence with each other. But, perish Chemistry‚ Mathe-

matics, and every sciente, and let Conceptualism prevaill — Can absurdity
go larther?

Possibly3 at least it may become more striking. You deny that,
when a general term is used, anything general is meant beyond the
word itsell‚ or at best, beyond an abstract idea, Very well. Here is a
man who promises to pay sive pounds. He is out ol cash just now, so

he cannot be thinking ol any particular coin or banknote in his possession.
What then does he promise? Something identical with, and equivalent
to, any existing sum ol live pounds. Is what he promises, onlya word?
ls itan abstraction? Then what is his promise worth in either case?
business men are not likely to think highly ol such a theory. And il
you say that he promises to pay certain singulars, without specifyino,¹
which, I reply that A singular, Some singulars, All singulam, art·
general terms, and lall under the same class as the 'lire pounrls'. aml
present the same difficulty. ‘A singular’, not applied in thought to
this or that singular, in your theory either means nothing, or nothing· real.
