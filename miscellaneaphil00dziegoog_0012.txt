An Essay on Wyclif’s Philosophical System.

After the publication, by the Wyclil Society, ol De Compositione
Hominis, ol De Ente Praedicamenloli, and ol the three volumes ol Logico‚
lately issued, enough is now known ol this philosopher's general system
and trend ol thought to render a synopsis ol his philosophy quite possible.
This synopsis appears to be particularly in its place at the beginning ol
the works now to be published, in which he develops his principles
more elaborately and iu greater detail. Nor can we doubt that the
synthesis ol what has already appeared will be ol use lor what is to
come - lor the two volumes ol Miscellaneo. and lor those, much more
numerouS, ol Wyclil s great work, De Enle.

The words ol lsaiah in the Revised Version: ‘How art thou fallen
lrom heaven. Ο day-star, son ol the morningl' can alone adequately
render the extremes ol Wyclil's late: world-wide celebrity in his own
times complete oblivion in ours. The man who devoted his lise to
stemming the theu all but irresistible tide of Nominalistic philosophy; ·
whose subtle genius drew to him at Oxlord anumerous and enthusiastic
hand ol lollowerS, who iu the sust years ol his Mastership at Balliol
Hall elaborated a system ol philosophy perhaps more daring than that
ol any Englishman belore him, certainly as comprehensive and as surely
following lrom his first principles as any, whether before him or alter;
who. driven step by step towards the natural conclusions ol his system,
was the first to rise up against Rome, and to inaugurate the movement
which culminated in HusS, and ended with Ziska: - that man is now
so utterly lorgot'ten3 what he may ur may not have thought is so ab·
solutoly indifferent even to cultured miuds iu the present day, that his
Latin works, now being published by the Wyclil Society lor upwards ol
stlteen years, are almost unread in his own native country.
