modern Physics and Chemistry. Some go so lar as to assert that in Sir
William Thompson’s (Lord Kelvin's) theory of the vortex atom, we have
the old doctrine: the vortex movement is form, the ‘perfect lluid’ is
matter; the two together make the atom. But we may now return to
Wyclil, who uses the same terms, as we shall see, to designate totally
different ideas

Ch. Ι. Form may be verbally defined as that through, or according
to which any being is intrinsically iltis or thus3 il ‘according to which',
it is extrinsic form, or the pattern or exemplar of the thing made3 il
‘through which’‚ itis intrinsic3 substantial if it makes the thing to be this
thing, accidental is it makes it to be thus. Wyelif, before dealing with
extrinsic or ideal forms, gives us a few preliminary remarks on the two
other species. Substantial form makes its substance to be what it is, and
accidental sorm is merely the mode of a substance, i. e. the substance
itsels existing (or acting) in this or that way. Every accident requires a
subject, and it is only in a different sense - that os beauty, gootlness
and perlection — that Augustine calls God the Supreme and seli-existent
Mode (pp. 163-167). All accidents are forms ola substance: asto their
degree of entity, disputes, mostly verbal, have arisen3 some denying, some
doubting whether they had any or not. This is hardly consistent with
Scripture. Of the two extreme doctrines - one of which says that every

thing must be sels-existent, and so an accident is nothing3 and the other
that God is the only substance, all creatores being accidents (the very
essence ol Spinoza’s doctrine) - Wyclif declares that he admits neither,
but states that the world, though it is an accident to God, is divided into
accident and substance, accidents bearing the same relation to their sub-

stances as created substances to God. As the latter cannot exist without
the First Canae, so the former cannot possibly exist without subjects.
He concludes the chapter by saying‚ in reference no doubt to former and
wearisome controversies on this point: “l am not going to argue the
matter again, unless arguments which Ι have not yet heard be brought
lorward” (pp. 167-170). Notice why he admits, in seemingly perilous
agreement with the Pantheistic doctrine of Spinoza‚ that ‘the world is an
accident to God'. Itis because the Universal Man, who comprises all
possible men - that is, all men past, present and future - is to him
areality which depends upon God, and, so lar as l can understand, is
an eternal existence in God; and so ol all other created things.
