LVIII lNTRODllCTlON.

Stephens', assertiou, adopted by Dudik, that the treatises bearing
Wyclif's name, Nos. I, ΙΙΙ and V, were unknown and unprinted, now
only holds good in part. Dudik himself ol course helped to make their
existence known to the learned world. Nos. V and ΙΙΙ, “De universalibus'’
and “De materia et lorma’' are in Shirley’s list oi Wyclil's original works,
though he omits “De individuacione temporis et instantis”. (Although
Shirley's catalogue dates lrom 1865 and Dudik's “Forschungen &c.‘’
l‘rom 1851, the latter’s work was not turned to account by the former.)
Since Lechler’s time they have been included in all works upon Wyclil
which have any pretence to completeness. It will be remembered srom
what has been said above that three treatises bearing the same names
as these three were among the works burned on July 16⁰¹, 1410. Very
soon aiter this remarkable day, disputatione were delivered at the University
oi Prague in deience ol this very treatise “De universalibus'' by Idislaw
v. Zwinzeticz’ and “De materia et iorma'’ by Johann v. Giezin.

But to a certain extent the dictum oi Stephens and Dudik above
mentioned still holds good. It is a most remarkable fact that not even
at this day is there a single one oi Wyclil’s philosophical works in
print.¹ And this circumstance is all the more notable‚ when one remembers
what a reputation ior acumen and dialectical ability he enjoyed among
his contemporaries as well as with posterity,2 since we osten find “Subtilis

vir”‚ “Subtilis magister” applied to the English reformer.

Latterly, however, great interest has been awakened both in the
man and his works. The real impulse seems to have been due to Pro·
sessor Walter Waddington Shirley ol Oxlord‚ who died in 1866. Of his
excellent “Catalogue'’ 1 have already spokeu; and besides this he published
another work ol great importance ior the subject, “F asciculi Zizaniorum''.
ln 1880, WycliI's works in English were given to the public, but these
are inconsiderable both in value and extent, compared with his Latin
writings. In March 1882 the Wyclif Society was founded in England lor
the purpose ol editing and publishing Wyclil’s still unprinted Latin workS,

¹ See Note 1, p. XLVll. 2 Posterity has, however, not estimeted Wyclii’s
scientific ability and importance so highly as his contemporaries, or as he deserved
(vide LeChler: J. v. Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformatiou l, 34 et seq.)·
The effect of his great importance as a reformer has in some degree been to
oveshadow his repnte as a philosopher.
