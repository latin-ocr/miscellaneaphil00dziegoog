XLIV INTRODUCTlON.

that alone. A man who has sinned is not to blame because 116 is now
able not to have sinned, but because, when he did, he had the power
not to sin. At the beginning of the world the possibility of my being
born Ilien existed; as time went on, it became less3 at the instant of
my birth it was narrowed to that instant and no other (pp. 74—87).

Chapters 2 aad 3 (pp. 87-116) are perhaps the hardest to nn·

derstand in the whole treatise3 audit will suffice to give a short synopsis
of Wyclif's theory and of those which he assailed. As a consequence of
their denial of the necessity of propositions concerning the past, which
has already been summarized, Nominalists were forced to take up the
position that possibility or impossibility depended upon the axiom: no-
thing can be and noi be al lire sume time. Whatcver did not contradict
this (and things past, no longer existing, could not contradict it) was '
contingently true or false, but always possible3 what contradicted it was
impossible independently of any other truth. This therefore was the only
criterion of the extent of God's power. Wyclif attacks this doctrine with
great vehemence‚ attempting to show that, if things contingent in the
presentare contingent in the past, the proposition that Nothing in the
world crisis is admissible in that theory3 wherce he draws the most
damaging aad absurd inferences against his adversaries. Apossibility
independcnt of God is according to him the source ol numberless errors
which 116 points out in detail. lle is convinced that the proposition, or
rather the fact (though he seems not to distinguish between the two)
llrat God enisis, is the primordial truth on which the axiom of contra-
diction depends It is because God exists that Nothing can at the same
time be and not he; and not vice versa. All possibility and impossibility
therefore proceed from God's power. We cannot say that God's power
does not extend to this because it is impossible; but, This is impos-
sible, on account of God’s power not extending to it. And, though such
an assertion looks extravagant, if we remember what he means by pos-
sible (that which at any time exists or will exist) it is in keeping with the
rest of his doctrine. At the same time, whilst he was free not to admit
a wider defmhion, his Nominalist adversaries had quite as much right to
define the Possible as that os rvlricli ilie existence, no matter at what
time, does nol involve contradiction.

ln the last chapter, there is a return to the preceding question of
‘quality’. But whereas Wyclif argned before that no mental act was a
