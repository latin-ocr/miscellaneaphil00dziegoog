wird der Schluss: dass Huss kaum der Verfasser dieser Abhandlung sei,

ein verzeihlicher.'' To this there are some points ol evidence to be

added, which though they provide no infallible testimony, nevertheless
tend strongly in favour ol Wyclil's authorship ol this particular treatise,
evidence too which clearly cannot have been known to Dudik, Stephens
and Pedirka, because it is only the research ol recent years which has
brought it to light. Ι mean first ol all the relations which existed in a
general way between Huss and Wyclil. There is no doubt that these
latest investigations have gone to show (Ι refer especially to Luserth's
work “Huss and Wiclil” which marks an era in our knowledge), how
intimate this association was, how Huss even in his maturest manhood
never broke his close and pupil-like connexion with his English master.
And as it has been made clear that in the work of his riper years he
almost mechanically adopted, nay to a great degree simply reproduced
in writing, the spoken utterances os Wyclil, are we not justified in
supposing that in his youth Huss held a position of even less independence
with respect to his admired tencher, and especially in regard to speculative
work which called lor a greater experience ol lile and maturity than he
himself possessed?

Another circumstance which tends in the same direction is that in
the List which Loserth gives os Wyclil's writings that were burnt twelve
years later (in 1410) by the order of Archbishop Zbinco on account of
their reputed heretical tendencies, four out ol the five treatises ol the
Stockholm Manuscript occurs. The only one which is not among them
is the “Replicacio de universalibus”, the very treatise in lact which Dudik
maintains was undoubtedly written by Huss, though lor my part 1 am
lor certain reasons inclined to doubt even this.

The fact that Archbishop Zbinco caused to be burned one or
more copies ol treatises by Wyclil bearing the same name is of course
no real prool that he is the author ol the Stockholm treatise ‘de Ydeis’.
'l‘his can evidently only be decided by an accurate comparison between
the original ol the copy or copies which were consigned to the llames,
and that which we have at Stockholm. But the fact above referred to
goes at least to support the plausibility ol the supposition that Huss did
not write Nu. 2 ‘de Ydeis’.¹ In Prokop v. Pilsen's speech in delente ol

¹ Loserth's list ol the burnt writings also makes it probable that Wyclil was
the author ol “De veris universalibus”.
