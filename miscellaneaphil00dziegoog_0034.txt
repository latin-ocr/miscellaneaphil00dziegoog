ΑΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLlF'S PHILOSOPHlChL SYSTEM. XXVII

wreck thought, the whirlpools which engull it: but we philosophical
mariners will not be advised and every one steers sor the rocks to
keep clear ol the whirlpool, orior the whirlpool to avoid the rocks
Or, to revert to our former illustration‚ suppose a set os looking-glasses
endowed with human laculties, longing to get at the things they
represent. One ol them might cry: “There is no room save the room
which l mirror within me; lor the reflection is the room‚ and the
rellection is identical with me’‘. And another: “Rellection proceeds lrom
outside, its cause cannot be within me: and therefore it were impossible
to judge whether what l mirror has any likeness at all with the roem,
unless 1 could get out ol mysell”. The former would end by denying
a separate existence to the room, the latter by refusing to believe
anything at all about it. In like manner do these two contrary trends of
thought proceed‚ some philosophers going samber, others not so lar, but
always iu two contrary directions, and both hercely intolerant ol so tame
a middle course as that which has been sketched above. Wyclil belonged
to the former, and these at least maintain the character and the value
ol human knowledge3 their excesses and errors at least do not attach

the foundations ol thought. But the others, whatever their ingenuity and
acumen in minor matters may be, strike by the very lorce ol their first
principle at the roots ol the human understanding and ol all truth‚ and
their genius does but stultily itsell. Against this tendency‚ very powerlul

in his time, Wyclil's system was a reaction; as such, 'it was certainly
justified3 and if, like all reactions, it went too lar, it has at least a claim
to be judged with leniency.
