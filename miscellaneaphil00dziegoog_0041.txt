work is purely metaphysical in its aim and in most 01 the questions
dealt with. It is in two parts; the first (pp. 1-58) has three chapterS,
oue 01 which (pp. 1—34) attacks the theory that mental acts are things
distinct lrom the mind3 the second (pp. 34-38) is a summary 01 the
arguments in favour 01 the position that such acts ure qualities (which,
it would appear, some philosophers understood as being separable
entities); and the third (pp. 38—58) is consecrated to the refutation 01
these arguments, ’1110 second part (pp. 59-128) is in four chapterS,
the first 01 which (pp. 59-87) deals with the question whether the
mental act ol affirmation, 11 relating to the past, must be either necessarily
true or necessarily lalse. The second attacks the position that no
mental act save an affirmation which implies sels-contradiction can imply

' absolute impossibility (pp. 87--1o5). The third (pp. 105- 116) establishes

Wyclif's theory: that God's existence is the necessary truth on which
both possibility and impossibility depend, and the lourth (pp. 116-128)
reverting to the theory 01 mental acts considered as qualities‚ argues
that even 11 they were, no quality can be au absolute accident, separable
lrom its substance.

First Pari, Ch. 1. Alter enumerating various mental kinds 01 acts
— sensations, thought, volition 3ηά emotion — Wyclif at once states
his view: these acts cannot he thought as entities distinct lrom the
mind. This discussion, 01 which the language is quite foreign to
that 01 modern metaphysicians, reveals nevertheless a great deal 01
proluund and earnest thought upon a subject closely resembling one
that has much interest lor philosophers in our days3 and many 01 the
arguments, 11 stripped 01 their old-world form and dressed up in the
terminology 01 XXtem century science, would look strikingly new, and

give him that used them great claims to deep and original thought3 aml

Ι say this the more openly because Ι am perlectly aware that uo one

self what Wyclil might justly claim as his own. We well know that many
metaphysicians deny the existence ol a Subject. For them there are only
leelingS, thoughts, volitionS, &c.; the Subject is a mere ‘hypostatized
abstraction'. 11 so, they are exactly in the same position, or at least
assailable by the same kind 01 objections, as those who in our philo-
sopher’s time gave to mental acts an entity capable 01 existing by
