lNTRODUCTlON. LVII

nevertheless generally mentions by a still more honorable title, “Venerabilis
incept0r”. Or it may even be that he refers directly to Augustine (cl.
Lechler: Johann v. Wiclil und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation Ι, p. 4613
ll, p. 610). Dudik surthermore seeks support lor the claim ol Huss in
the lact that we find no omissions in the Manuscript ol this treatise, as
we do for instance in No, l, as well as in the comparatiuely rare cor-
rections which here occur. But when we consider how short this treatise
is, covering as it does only nine leaves, this state ol things seems by
no means remarkable. For corrections do occur, and among the other

treatises one could easily find a long series ol pages entirely wanting
in omissions.

The course ol my investigation has therefore led me to the con·
clusion that the authorship ol the four longer treatises contained in the
Stockholm MS. may be attributed to Wyclis with an amount ol probability
which is all but equivalent to certainty, while with regard to the short
summmy, entitled “Replicacio de universalibus'’, it is quite credible that
it is due to his hand as well.

The words ol the text “per manus Hus de Hussynetz’' will then

reler merely to the actual writer. That Huss with his own hand wrote
at least the greater part, il not the whole, os this Manuscript, seems
highly probable. The Bohemian works and phrases which occur point
to a writer to whom this language was familiar.¹ Furthermore‚ Dr. Dudik
sent through Professor Dr. Kolenati two sacsimile passages out os this
Manuscript to Herr Hanka os Prague, where Huss' original writings are
preserved. One os these passages happened to be a part os the first
treatise in which the words “haha czechu” seems to have been written
hy a different hand lrom the Manuscript itsels (Cap. ιο, see Appendix).
ΜΓ. Hanka declared the whole Manuscript to be the work ol Huss (os
course with the exception of certain additions, corrections &c which are
undoubtedly os later date). A lreslr comparison between lacsimiles from
other parts os this codex and the originals of Huss at Prague ought to
finally settle this question.

¹ According to Dudik, these occasione] Behcmian words were probably inserted
only to fill up the lines (“eine damalige Modesache”), and are quite without bearing
on the text. But nn expression tite that which we find on leaf 43 (see appendix),
ns well as one on leal 51, has at least some connexion with the text.
