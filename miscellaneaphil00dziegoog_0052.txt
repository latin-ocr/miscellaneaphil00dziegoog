INTRODUCTlON. XLV

quality in the opponents’ sense, he now argues that ¹in that sense there
is no such thing. lt is, we must remember⁷ an accident capable (at least
by God’s power) ol existing separately from its substance. Wyclil very
guardedly relrains from saying that quantity or the ‘vis extensiva sub-
stantia, cannot exist alone. This was generally admitted at the time by
Schoolmen. though, as Ι have pointed out in De Apostasia‚ it forms no
part oi the doctrine os the Church ol Rome. On the other hand, most
Schoolmen admitted that material qualities, such as colour, taste‚ weight, &c
were absolutely dependent upon the quantity os a substance. and could
not be conceived apart therelrom. lt was thus a doctrine which, to say
the least, was very lar from being unassailable: but he attacks it with ar·
guments that are, most ol them at least, quite as adaptable to quantity;
in lact, some ol thern were used by Descartes when he denied the theory
ol absolute accidents'. But it is certain that an open attach would have
raised a storin which Wyclil probably did not at the time leel it his
duty to meet3 and thus (possibly, as l have already said, in view
ol the Mastership at Balliol College) he preferred to employ argu·
ments which attacked quantity as an absolute accident without ever
naming it.

Some accidents — relations, lor instance - are inconceivable as
existing apart lrom substance. This essential distinction must be common
to all. :ln accident existing separately would become a substance: which
is impossible. ll it could exist alone, and consequently act alone, it would
be more perlect than material substanceS, which cannot act but by means
ol their qualities Substance is defined as that which underlies accideris.
Now, if a quality could act by itsell, it could by itsell be also acted
upon and modisted, receive movement‚ &c — that is, underlie accidentS,
and thus become a substance. 'l'he whole world might be made up ol
absolute accidente, and the. idea ol substance thus becomes superfluousg
we could not distinguish between things and appearanceS, and appear·
ances would be to us as things. ll this, sor instance, were extended to
mental acts, there might be a sensation of whiteness that could perceive
awhite colour, without any person to leel it (pp. 116—121). Here
Wyclil examines the adversaries' reply. 'l'hey naturally sall back upon a
misaele, saying that an accident never has power to exist by itsell3 it

would, in such a case, be upheld by Divine omnipotence. We infallibty

ltnow that substances underlie appearanceS, unless there be a miracle;
