lNTRODUCTlON. LXXIX

nothing else but the atoms which fill the whole of space and cor·
respond to each point of the same, and which at one time may form
the body of a man, at another that of an ass, but never exist without
any form.

Ch. 5. But Wyclif's antagonists are not yet beaten. Are we, they
say, to deny the value of the following syllogism: this is A,· this same
thing is B,· therefore A is B? Wyclif asserts that a given man is thul rt'ltich
possesses humanity3 that the same given man is identical with his

humanity; yet he denies that matter is form, and that humanity is identical

with that which possesses it. As to his examples, those of the Trinity
and the Incarnation explain the unknown by what is more unknown yet;
and that of the humanity, common to its singulars Peter and Paul, merely
begs the question, since most philosophers deny the reality of Universals.
Resides, if matter and form are two distinct natures, how can they inter-
penetrate each other so as to make up one compound (pp. 196-198)?

To this Wyclif replies by asserting that neither matter nor form
nor compound is identical one with another, although they have one
essenee. lle points out various senses of the words nature and simplicity,
and then comes to the fundamental distinction which, in his theory,
obtains between matter, form and compound. The former is the essence
qud receptive of form; the latter is the same essence qua' generable in
matter. These, taken singly, are each the simple essence; when together,
they are the compound. This therefore is identical with neither, but with
both. lt possesses the quality of being able to have a form, and also
that of actually having it, We may call the abstract essence a ‘nature’,
as we may call the compound or its components by the same name, but
with different significations. And here we see where the syllogism given
abore is faulty. A given man is identical with that which, ete. and he is
also identical with his humanity3 but he is not identical from the same
point of view (pp. 198-203). —- Ater touching on the question whether
there may be many sorts of primal matter, Wyclif clears himself of blame
as concerno the instances he has given. ln Aristotle's time everybody
admitted that a universal term was common to all its singulars, and the
denial of this in modern times has driven men to absurd assertione As
to the lioly Trinity, Wyclif only intended to prove that anyone who
maintained the absurdity of the system would be also obliged to deny the
Catholic saith, and the example of Christ’s double nature in one Person
